</p><p class="lede">Amid a heavy dose of inside jokes, Dave has some choice words for Zak and Justin&#8217;s trade attempts, and throws some trash talk at Pat.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>First off, what was that trade? A bunch of free agent dreck for a 1st and 2nd rounder. That’s a veto son. I heard Justin was busy sizing his cranium for a crown before our draft. His first five picks were Sanchez Butt Fumble bad so I knew it wasn’t happening.</p>

Needless to say we’re watching you Zak.</p>

<p>The Sultan is facing Pat’s Hard Balls this week.</p>

<p>From what I can deduce, Pat tracks his life between boners.
(below just a sampling of what would fit into a screenshot).</p>

No pinnacles this week for P-Dwydy. I’m gonna shut you up so completely, folks’ll think adolescent Quiet Pat is back: expressionless and toting some killer circle glasses. I’m tired of your voice Pat!</p>

The only noble virtue this week is BUTTSOLA!</p>

<p>Time for some painful nightmares, Dwyer.</p>
