<p>13 points is a <em>lot</em> in the NFL. Baltimore couldn&#8217;t cover versus Cleveland last night despite getting a defensive touchdown and playing good football. Anyway, we will find out today if any of these lines have moved due to the resolution of the referee lockout (if they do, they will likely shift away from home teams). Strangely, the Vikings-Lions game is not listed, although <a href="http://www.vegas.com/gaming/">vegas.com</a> has it at Detroit -4.5. Most of the lines shown here are about half- to a full-point wider than Vegas. Anyway, the ones we like for this weekend are:</p>
<p><strong>San Francisco -5 at New York Jets</strong></p>
<p>Jim Harbaugh hates losing. He&#8217;s kept the team back east all week, practicing at Youngstown State in Ohio and I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;s been saying things to his defense that would make <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/05/sports/la-sp-sn-williams-saints-20120405">Gregg Williams</a> seem like a saint (insert Saints joke here). But seriously&#8230; an angry Niners defense against one of the most skittish quarterbacks in the league? I want. The Jets are 2-1 like the Niners, but these are two teams heading in different directions. Sure, the Niners are coming off a loss, but they weren&#8217;t comfortable sitting as the consensus best team in the NFL anyway. This team, like its coach, does best with a chip on its shoulder. The Jets are coming off an overtime victory against the lowly Dolphins and have a tough upcoming schedule: Niners, Texans and Patriots in the next four weeks. Also, the Jets have lost Darelle Revis for the season and the on-field/off-field splits for the NYJ defense without Revis are absurd. I can&#8217;t find them right now, but ESPN has been showing them all week. One stat (this is from memory so don&#8217;t quote me on it) is that the Jets have not picked off a pass when Revis wasn&#8217;t on the field since he arrived in New York.</p>
<p><strong>Atlanta -8 vs. Carolina</strong></p>
<p>The Panthers are not very good. They lost to the Bucs week one, won a shootout with the Saints (perhaps the worst defense in the NFL right now) week two, and got blown out at home by the Giants last Thursday. After Philly, the Panthers have the most giveaways of any team in the NFC right now (eight). The Falcons have the most takeaways in the league (11). And this game is at the Georgia Dome, where Matty Ice is spectacular. Here&#8217;s his home split: 31 games, 27-4&#160;W-L, 64.9% completion rate, 51 TD, 17 INT, 98.4 passer rating. What&#8217;s the over/under for combined receiving touchdowns for Julio Jones, Roddy White, and Tony Gonzalez? What ever it is, I want to parlay the over with Atlanta -8.</p>
<p><strong>New England -4 at Buffalo</strong></p>
<p>There are few certainties in sports. But one of them is that when you try to fit a narrative to something, you will fail miserably. That said, I love back-on-track games (see Niners above) and I firmly believe this is one for the Patriots. They&#8217;re below .500 for the first time since 2003 (I think ESPN <em>might</em> have mentioned this, just briefly, maybe once on SportsCenter this week). They&#8217;re playing a divisional opponent away. They have one of the most skilled offenses in the league even without Hernandez, and according to Bill Barnwell and his number machine, <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8434708">Tom Brady is the best quarterback in the last 20 years</a>. This is where the Patriots say to the league &#8220;Hey guys, remember us? We represented the AFC in the Super Bowl last year? We&#8217;re the best team of the past decade? Yeah, back the fuck off. I&#8217;m looking at you Houston.&#8221; It&#8217;s either that or this is where the cracks start to show. But I&#8217;m taking Brady with a chip on his shoulder every time.</p>
<p><strong>New York Giants +2 at Philadelphia</strong></p>
<p>We had to talk ourselves into this one a little bit, but I think we&#8217;re in now. These are the facts:</p>
<ul><li>The Giants are tied for second in takeaways in the NFC with eight.</li>
<li>The Eagles are dead last in the NFL in giveaways, having turned it over a staggering 12 times in three games<em><em>. </em></em></li>
<li>Turnover margin is the statistic most strongly correlated with winning and losing in the NFL.Â </li>
<li>The Eagles are 2-1 but their two victories were by a combined two points. Their point differential is -19 after three games.</li>
<li>The Giants are 2-1 and their point differential is +29.</li>
<li>Eli Manning + Victor Cruz + Hakeem Nicks &gt; Mike Vick + DeSean Jackson + Jeremy Maclin</li>
</ul><p>You are now on board with this pick as well.</p>
<p>Here are some we like a little less&#8230; but still kinda like</p>
<p><strong>Green Bay (-8) v. New Orleans</strong></p>
<p>The Packers have the biggest imaginable chip on their shoulder. Speaking of which, I noted before how I hate the name Golden Gate for this fiasco, but I saw one earlier today I absolutely love: Fail Mary. Boom. Anyway, yes, I want Aaron Rodgers with a chip on his shoulder and something to prove against the dismal Saints defense. Often defenses are described as &#8220;porous&#8221; or called a &#8220;sieve.&#8221; The operative concept here is that they are things that let liquid through. The Saints defense takes this a step further though; I think the most apt comparison would just be a bucket with the bottom knocked out.</p>
<p><strong>Oakland +7 at Denver</strong></p>
<p>We talked about this last night and we sorta liked it. I have no idea why. I&#8217;m not touching this one.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh yeah. Oakland is sneaky-good, Palmer seems to get a little better each week, and Peyton&#8217;s throws look terrible. Still, I dunno.</p>
