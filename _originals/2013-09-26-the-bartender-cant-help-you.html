<p class="lede">Dave heaps abuse on Ali to set the stage for their Week 4 matchup.</p>

<p>But he probably could have picked a better team. After silencing Pat, and out crafting the cunning ham, The Sultan sets his sights on Ali (I cannever spell his last name correct) Mushpotatoes… Oh! So close</p>

<p>Here’s a question:</p>

<p>If I trash talk my opponent every week, but they never read or respond, is it really hurting them?</p>

<p>Anyways, instead of writing a long winded description about how thoroughly I’m going to destroy Ali’s lame excuse for a team, I’ve made this GIF which illustrates my plan of attack.</p>
