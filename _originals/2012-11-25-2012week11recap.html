<div class="intro">
<p class="body-copy">What a bizarre week in the NFL. The Texans narrowly escaped the <em>Jags</em>. The Falcons won despite a -5 turnover margin with Matt Ryan becoming the first QB since 1967 to win a game while throwing five picks and no touchdowns. The sagging Jets offense somehow scored 27 points. Backup quarterbacks were seemingly everywhere: Jacksonville, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Philly. Things were strange, to say the least, in fantasy too. The squads who were previously racking up points fell flat, while those that were struggling posted huge days. Here are your week 11 recaps.

<p class="body-copy">O ye of little faith! Ali committed a fantasy cardinal sin this week and missing the playoffs might be his penance. For the first time this season (other than the Niners’ bye) Ali opted to go with Brandon Pettigrew over Vernon Davis. True, VD has been unproductive lately, but Pettigrew hasn’t been dramatically better. Further, while Hoop only scored 74 this week, his team is the highest-scoring in the league and Davis clearly has more upside. Finally, “thou shalt always start thy studs” is fantasy commandment number one. Sure enough, the fantasy gods smote Ali for his heresy, with Davis outscoring Pettigrew 14 to two. Ali lost by four. In his first career start Colin Kaepernick was looking Davis’s direction from the very start, hitting him with a beautiful play action pass down the sideline on the third play of the game for 22 yards. Davis finished with six catches for 83 yards a score, good for his second best fantasy performance of the season. Ali had major problems elsewhere on his roster too; besides Pettigrew’s two-point contribution, he had two donuts and another two-point performance. The abysmal Saints secondary was somehow able to limit Denarius Moore to a single catch for nine yards, while Ronnie Brown gained just nine yards on four carries backing up Ryan Mathews. Mike Williams has tailed off noticeably of late; as the Tampa offense gets humming it seems they need him less and less. Jamaal Charles was decent (11 FP) but hasn’t flashed that game-breaking talent at all since shredding the Saints in week three. Two standouts were LaRod Stephens-Howling and Peyton Manning. Stephens-Howling’s stat line looks stupendous (22 carries for 127 yards, 5.77 avg, 1 TD) but temper your expectations. The Falcons have struggled with the run all year, and 92 of LSH’s 127 yards (72%) came on just two runs – a 40-yarder in the first quarter and a 52-yard scamper in the second. Still 18 FP is nothting to scoff at, although with Beanie Wells’s imminent return Ali might have to put Stephen-Howlings back on the shelf. Finally, Peyton. The zip on his throws seems to improve weekly, and he’s sitting at fourth among QBs in FP, behind only the Rodgers-Brady-Brees triumvirate. On Sunday he threw for three touchdowns for the sixth time in his last seven outings, and has posted 23 FP or better in eight of his ten games.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Ali’s impiety really bailed out Hooper this week. His team was mediocre across the board yet he still escaped with a win and now controls his own destiny as the competition for first-round byes intensifies in the last two weeks of the season. There were a couple of surprises here but it was just one of those down weeks for Hoop. With AP on bye, he started Frank Gore and Kendall Hunter against the Bears. Despite getting blown out by the Niners the Bears did a serviceable job stopping the run. Danny Amendola was up against the Jets who have quietly been among the stingiest defenses for fantasy receivers. Jimmy Graham’s eight FP was a little surprising given the Raiders’ endless defensive woes. The most mystifying, however, was the Texans D/ST. That unit has been suffocating all year, squeezing the life out of teams with hellacious run defense and an opportunistic squad adept at forcing turnovers. But they somehow had no answer for Chad Henne and the Jaguars, who rang up 37 points on them. Houston somehow escaped with a win, despite facing a two touchdown deficit halfway through the fourth quarter, and this game feels like a strange fluke more than anything. Likewise, chalk up Hoop’s 74-point outing as an oddity rather than an omen.</p>

<p class="body-copy">Shit happens in fantasy. All kinds of shit. These little flurries of shit add up into shit-storms, and shit-storms will cost you a game here or there. Rarely, although it does happen, these shit-storms coalesce in to a shit-superstorm, complete with a shit-stormsurge and shit-tornadoes. That’s a fair assessment of my team this week. Not to brag, but my team has been strong this year. Matt Ryan and Arian Foster have led the charge, supported by strong showings from Reggie Wayne, Julio Jones, and Willis McGahee. Those five players combined this week for <em>14 total points</em>. Their combined weekly average previously was 74. My two studs (Ryan and Foster) combined for a hilariously miserable TWO points. <em>That</em> is a shit-superstorm. I’m not sure ESPN’s “projection” system has ever been more wrong. It expected me to outscore ZM by 13 points – instead he dealt me a 91-point beating. ESPN’s system was off by only 104 FP. No big deal. To add insult to injury (well, more acurately, the other way around), Willis McGahee will miss the remainder of the fantasy season with an MCL tear. Ugh. Hopefully my guys will bounce back with a vengance. If not, I’m royally fucked.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Due credit to ZM, his team was on fire this week. Andre Johnson had a stellar game, the Patriots D/ST scored three touchdowns, and even Jonathan Stewart was in double digits. Vincent Jackson continued to dominate while Cam Newton put up a respectable 20 FP. Not that all this firepower was necessary – he scored more than three times as many points as me – but it’s encouraging for him down the stretch. At 5-6 he still has an outside shot to make the playoffs, and he helped his tiebreaker standing with a 130-point game. There are some big problems here though. LeSean McCoy suffered a concussion late in the Eagles blowout loss to the Redskins, and Mike Wallace will be receiving passes from third-stringer Baron Batch for the foreseeable future. Those aren’t insurmountable hurdles but they certainly make the road ahead much more difficult.</p>

    <span class="matchup-teams">BREES CAN’T SING BUT HE CAN BALL v. THAT’S NO MOON</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">You can’t blame Dave for leaving Blackmon on the bench. Prior to Sunday’s tilt against the Texans Blackmon had 250 yard receiving and one TD on the season and was averaging 3.2 FPPG. He nearly matched that output (236 yds., 1 TD) on Sunday. Sure, seeing a 29 on the bench is awful, but this was the right call. You know what the wrong call was? Not playing Robert “Black Jesus” Griffin III. It’s long since been time to roll with the punches and start RG3 every week. While the point difference here wouldn’t have changed the outcome, total points will come in to play for tiebreakers. Dave still has an edge in points for but other teams are moving in to striking distance. Obviously, the problems extend beyond roster decisions. He has a bunch of big-name guys that aren’t living up to expectations. Larry Fitzgerald in particular bears watching. The QB situation in Arizona is a mess (who the fuck is Ryan Lindley!?) and while elite receivers can find a way to be effective, a sixth-round rookie under center could absolutely crush his value. Dave will still likely make the playoffs but he’s in a precarious spot at the moment.</p>
<p class="body-copy">83 points with two starters on bye and two goose eggs is pretty damn good. Zak’s main guys all turned in decent performances and Dave’s terrible decision making put this one in Zak’s column early. The only thing I worth noting in particular is Marcel Reece. Let’s not get too excited – they did play the Saints after all – but he had a huge game. He piled up 193 scrimmage yards, including 90 receiving yards on just four catches. Zak seems to have found a flex guy on whom he can rely in the playoffs. It’s too early to tell for sure, but the signs are all there. Another thing to note is Zak’s sudden RB depth. Shane Vereen’s 11 FP was an anomaly, but Ingram has 28 touches over the last two weeks and appears to be gaining the trust of the Saints offensive coaches. Better late than never I suppose. James Starks had 26 total touches, though he scored just seven FP. I’m interested to see how this shakes out.</p>

    <span class="matchup-names">Max v. Jenny</span>
    <span class="matchup-teams">FUCK YOU AARON SORKIN v. YOU’RE KILLING ME ELI</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">Eli’s bye week allowed Jenny to get killed by Ryan Fitzpatrick instead. In a thoroughly uninspiring Thursday night effort Fitzpatrick went 17 of 27 for 168 yards and no touchdowns. He added 15 yards rushing to push his output to a disappointing 7 FP. Most of her other guys were similarly underwhelming. Ray Rice gained just 40 yards on 20 carries, although he added 53 yards receiving (9 FP). Shonn Greene, Marques Colston and Miles Austin each contributed six or less while Maclin was held scoreless. Heroic efforts from the Ravens D/ST (23 FP) and Rob Gronkowski (25 FP) gave her a slim lead heading into Monday night but modest efforts by Brandon Marshall and Matt Forte for Max snatched this one away. Currently sitting on a five-game losing streak that has dropped her from a share of first place to under .500, she would actually still make the playoffs if the regular season ended now as the fifth team in. She leads the group of four 5-6 teams in points scored but the margin is tight – she’s up 14 points on Max (who would be the sixth and last team in) and 15 up on Ali, who would narrowly miss an invitation to the dance. Factor in Gronk’s broken arm, which will likely cost him the rest of the fantasy season, and things look dire. She does play last place AJ this week, whom she pounded 116-77 earlier this season, which gives her a decent chance to stop the bleeding. She also made some aggresive moves on the free agent market to add some depth. However, her chances largely rest on Ray Rice and Eli Manning performing well this week.</p>
<p class="body-copy">As much as Max has lamented the trade in which he sent Chris Johnson to Zak in exchange for Dez Bryant and Christian Ponder, Bryant has been stellar the past two weeks. His 20-point contribution was crticial in this matchup as a number of other guys underachieved. AJ Green’s touchdown streak continued as he notched 15 FP on six catches for 91 yards and a score. Carson Palmer (18 FP) wasn’t great, but did enough. Finally, the Broncos defense kicked in 14 FP to bring their double-digit game streak to three. Despite shaky performances by Reggie Bush (3 FP) and Greg Olson (4 FP) Max was down just six going into Monday night. Matt Forte and Brandon Marshall combined for 14 FP, mostly in garbage time, to propel him to a win. Max has ZM this week, and despite the beating he gave me this week, Max will be facing one of the easier squads to handle. Unfortunately his guys have a tough slate so this one could could be decided by a single big performance. Keep an eye on the Denver D/ST against the Chiefs and Dez Bryant against the Redskins, two of the easiest postitional matchups. A big day from both of those spots could go a long way towards securing Max a spot in the playoffs.</p>

    <span class="matchup-teams">THE BAUCE OF SAUCE v. TOWN TAXES</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">It sucks when your favorite real team kills you in fantasy. Pat knows the feeling. He was holding on to a tenuous seven-point lead going into Monday night with the Niners D/ST and David Akers left for Phil. In a dominant one sided affair that saw the Niners reel off 27 unanswered points before stepping off the gas, the SF defense and Akers combined for 31 FP and an emphatic victory for Phil. This was a terrible time to have Marshawn Lynch on bye as falling to 4-7 likely ends any playoff hopes Pat may have had. Alfred Morris has tailed off the past few weeks with five, seven and seven in the last three outings. Likewise, Tony Gonzalez has fallen back to earth after his torrid start. He rang up 24 FP last week, but that was the only time in the last five games he’s exceeded four FP. Calvin Johnson seems like he’s fixed whatever wasn’t working earlier this season but frankly it’s too little, too late for Pat’s team. Andy Dalton is also turning on the heat, going for 31 and 28 in his last two with a matchup against the Raiders coming up. Also, I’d like to point out the ballsy move of going with the terrible Redskins D/ST against the Eagles, which paid off in spades. It’s too bad Pat will probably miss the playoffs because he has one of the more explosive teams thanks to huge upside guys like Megatron, Roddy White and Gonzalez.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Ugh, it irks me when guys like Denario Alexander pay off. He tallied 19 FP last week on five catches for 134 yards and a touchdown against a questionable secondary. That performance bears all the hallmarks of a one-hit wonder. Perhaps a guy you might stash, but not a pick-up-and-start. Yet Phil did just that and was rewarded with 21 FP. He would have won this matchup if Alexander had posted a zero, but still. Anyway, the story here is nothing unexpected: Tom Brady carves up a bad defense. With solid performances by Mikel Leshoure and Randall Cobb (14 FP each) Phil was within striking distance by Monday night and sealed this one quickly. Despite a 128-point outburst, Phil’s team remains far behind in points scored. He’ll likely need to keep winning if he wants to make the playoffs because he won’t be winning any tiebreakers. Well, except against maybe ZM, over whom he holds a 65-point lead.</p>
<p class="scoreboard">Phil 128 (6-5); Pat 104 (7-4)</p>

    <span class="matchup-teams">NO WORK TODAY v. WE GOT NICKS LIKE JESUS</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">What do you say about a performance like Schaub’s? Yeah, he’s probably quite a bit better than a lot of people give him credit for. Yeah, if he was playing in the postseason last year the Texans might have made a run. But no, even a clinic like that won’t change the offensive philosophy of the Texans. Schaub’s 527 passing yards tied him for second most in a game ever. He tacked on five touchdowns and a pair of picks for a staggering 45 FP in Houston’s utterly unexpected shootout with the Jags. He didn’t need much in addition to that to put away Brian, who submitted his third straight sub-80 performance. The Law Firm chipped in 16 FP, his best outing of the season, and Felix Jones improbably extended his double-digit scoring streak to three games. Like Pat’s decision to play the miserable ‘Skins D/ST, AJ went with the dismal New Orleans D/ST against his own Raiders which yielded excellent dividends.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Brian dropped his third straight matchup to slip to 4-7, and likely out of the playoff picture. I really think Brian’s team is pretty decent, he’s just had some terrible breaks this year. With his two Giants coming back from bye he might be able to bounce back a little, but he’s closing out the season with the two 8-3 teams back-to-back. At best he’ll be a seeding spoiler – I know I for one will be rooting for him.</p>
<p class="scoreboard">AJ 108 (3-8); Brian 77 (4-7)</p>
