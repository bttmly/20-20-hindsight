<span>The 49ers are the best team in the NFL. Everyone wants to say it&#8217;s the Texans, but that&#8217;s pretty clearly not true. The Niners thrashed the Jets 34-0 in week 4. Those same Jets played the Texans close, losing by just six points. So that&#8217;s one thing. Second, the Niners continue to improve, and impress, on offense. <!-- more --> They smoked the Bills 45-3 and were the first team in NFL history to gain 300 yards passing and 300 yards rushing in the same game. They are scoring 2.2 points per point allowed which is the best ratio in the league. They also have the best ratio of yards gained to yards allowed (1.5-to-1). Alex Smith is currently leading in <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/qbr">QBR</a> and <a>passer rating</a>. Using QBR Smith&#8217;s performance against the Bills is ranked as the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/qbr/_/year/0/type/alltime-game">fifth best quarterback performance</a> since the stat&#8217;s inception in 2008, and at his current pace he&#8217;d notch the fourth best QBR season on record. It&#8217;s true the Niners&#8217; opponents haven&#8217;t been as good as advertised (I&#8217;m looking at you Packers and Lions) and they did lose to the only team over .500 they faced, but their opponents have a respectable combined record of 11-13. The Texans have played a miserable 8-17 slate including two 1-4 teams. Anyone who tells you they think the Texans could take on the Niners is either stupid or lying. And the Falcons? Please. The &#8220;defensively oriented&#8221; Niners have outscored the &#8220;air attack&#8221; Falcons by a smidge this season, and their defense is a zillion times better. The Falcons barely got by backup quarterback Kirk Cousins and the Redskins. Puh-leez.
<p>Over on ESPN, Gregg Easterbrook is <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/playbook/story/_/id/8479013/">still an insufferable douche</a>. Do they really pay this guy? Here&#8217;s a quote from this week&#8217;s column bemoaning the complexity of today&#8217;s NFL:</p></span>
<blockquote><div>Nearly all teams now use multiple checks, &#8220;sims&#8221; and audibles at the line of scrimmage. Offenses have dozens of formations with hundreds of possible plays. Defenses have multiple fronts, personnel packages for every down-and-distance, complicated twists and rotating coverages. Yet for all this complexity, game statistics have changed only a little in the last half century.</div></blockquote>
<p>Okay, two things. First, game statistics have changed more than &#8220;only a little in the last half century.&#8221; I&#8217;m trying to find a chart showing the steady increase in passing yards but I can&#8217;t find it. Suffice to say that after only two 5,000+ passing yard seasons ever, three guys passed that mark last year and another guy was within 70 yards of it. Second, even if his statement about stats were true wouldn&#8217;t that directly refute his point? Teams are drawn into an arms race of complexity <em>because it works</em>. Stats stay the same because these factors are cancelling each other out. Seriously, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuesday_Morning_Quarterback">this</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Easterbrook">guy</a> fucking sucks. Ugh. Here&#8217;s another one by this idiot:</p>
<blockquote><div><strong>Where Was His Ski Mask and Parka?</strong> When the weather turns, TMQ&#8217;s immutable law, Cold Coach = Victory, comes into play. The weather has not yet turned. Nevertheless for last Thursday night&#8217;s Cardinals at Rams indoor game, Arizona placekicker Jay Feely wore gloves. Placekickers don&#8217;t catch passes, and it was a balmy 70 degrees throughout the contest. If this is how Arizona players react when leaving their sun-drenched state, what&#8217;s going to happen when the Cardinals play at Jersey/B on Dec. 2?</div></blockquote>
<p>Jay Feely says <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSiEYLhodE8">"FUCK YOU"</a> as he reels in a pitch on a fake field goal and runs it in for a touchdown. While wearing gloves. Also, Gregg: your little nicknames for each team are horrendous. Enough of that, let&#8217;s get down to business with some recaps.</p>
<h3>Ali v. Brian</h3>
<p><em>Chomo Se Dice: Bolsa De Bolsas v. We Got Nicks Like Jesus</em></p>
<p>Trying to avoid going 1-4 and with five guys on bye, Ali managed to pull out a big performance. Aside from disappointing outings from Maurice Jones-Drew (5 FP) and Darren Sproles (2 FP) everyone on his team showed up on Sunday. Peyton posted 28 points doing what has become something of a routine in his short time in Denver - trying claw back from a big deficit. This must be frustrating for Broncos fans but it sure is good for Peyton&#8217;s fantasy value. The other huge performer was Victor Cruz, who took three of his five catches to the house, racking up 23 FP. Similarly, Robert Meachem caught just three balls but made the most of it by cashing in two for touchdowns. While he was only targeted four times on the day Meachem might see more targets going forward as Antonio Gates and Malcolm Floyd have been disappointing. Vernon Davis snagged five balls for 105 yards and is now second at tight end in fantasy points; he&#8217;s scored at least 10 points in four out of five weeks so far this season. Finally, Jamaal Charles came through with 16 points. Since his 34-point outburst week three he&#8217;s been averaging over 30 offensive touches per game (26.67 carries; 4 receptions) which is great news for Ali&#8230; as long as he can stay healthy. Despite scoring the second most points overall (498 PF, 99.6 avg.) Ali is just 2-3; unluckily, he&#8217;s had the most points scored against him. Brian&#8217;s squad wasn&#8217;t entirely miserable but that was largely thanks to Ahmad Bradshaw&#8217;s career day: 30 carries, 200 rushing yards, 1 rush TD, 4 receptions, 29 receiving yards (25 FP). In Big Ben&#8217;s last outing before the Steelers&#8217; bye he piled up 39 FP - this week against Philly, with two weeks to prepare, just nine. But what sticks out as the biggest problem is possibly the weakest pair of starting receivers in our league - Sidney Rice and Justin Blackmon. Yes, he has Eric Decker in the flex who&#8217;s obviously better than both of those guys, and I&#8217;m not saying Rice and Blackmon aren&#8217;t talented. But their inferior quarterbacks obliterate their fantasy value. They scored six and four this week respectively and that&#8217;s pretty much the most you&#8217;re going to get out of either unless they fall ass-backwards into a touchdown. Brian&#8217;s preferred options at receiver, Hakeem Nicks and Darrius Heyward-Bey, both figure to miss more time with injury so he&#8217;ll probably have to start at least one of these turds this week. Brian: with Nicks sidelined you should work on a new team name. Also, I don&#8217;t know why this just popped into my head but I think a buddy/cop comedy with Eric &#8220;Gym Rat&#8221; Decker and Justin &#8220;Class Act&#8221; Blackmon would be awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Ali 123 (2-3); Brian 83 (2-3)</strong></p>
<h3>Zak v. AJ</h3>
<p><em>Chain Gang v. No Work Today</em></p>
<p>As Drew Brees goes, so too goes Zak. He&#8217;s now 4-1 with wins in each of the four games Brees exceeded 24 FP, and was blown out by Jenny the one week Brees failed to reach 20. This week the New Orleans signal caller hit 35 FP for the second consecutive week, climbed atop the QB fantasy points leaderboard, and let Zak coast to an easy victory. His other guys came to play too though. Michael Turner continued to defy expectations, scoring a touchdown along with double-digit FP for the fourth straight week. Along with everyone else, I still think the wheels are going to fall off at some point but so far, so good. Even if he starts losing significant touches in meaningful situations the Falcons will be grinding down the clock in blowouts fairly often so he&#8217;ll still be involved. Unfortunately Zak has a crater at RB2. Besides Turner every other back on his team is currently a clear backup: Ronnie Hillman, Mark Ingram, and Bilal Powell. Powell should be in line to take over from Shonn &#8220;Worst Starting Back in the League&#8221; Greene but Joe McKnight is in the mix as well. The carry split on Monday night was eight for Greene, five for Tebow, and four each for Powell and McKnight. Also, Zak dropped Ingram today - frankly I have no idea what his plan at running back is going forward. I said last week he should look into dealing one of his three WR2 guys (Demaryius Thomas, Dez Bryant, DeSean Jackson) for a startable running back but with the thin depth at RB I&#8217;m not sure anybody feels like dealing a back for a receiver. Welker and Thomas both had big outings this week (16 and 15 FP) with Wes finding the end zone for the first time this season. Again, there could be a little cause for concern here with Aaron Hernandez coming back soon but Welker&#8217;s performance in Hernandez&#8217;s absence should have convinced the Pats they need to keep him involved. Also strong was the Seahawks D/ST whiuch posted 15 - the third double-digit outing in three games for that unit. Though his team was strong this week, it&#8217;s still surprising Zak is 4-1. He&#8217;s sixth in total points scored (471), just narrowly above Hoop (469) and Brian (467). He has fewer points than two 2-3 teams (Ali and Pat). If Brees can continue to lead the QB pack Zak has a good shot to stay the course, otherwise the numbers should catch up with him eventually. AJ&#8217;s team struggled big time this week, with only Percy Harvin really making a splash. Harvin is one of the most electric players in the NFL and finally broke through in fantasy this week, scoring his first receiving touchdown of the season along with a rushing score. Joe Flacco got the start for AJ and promptly stunk up the joint in the Ravens&#8217; narrow 9-6 win over the pitiful Chiefs; Flacco managed just 5 FP. AJ also had the misfortune of his two best backs going against two of the league&#8217;s best run defenses: Fred Jackson against the Niners and BenJarvus Green-Ellis versus the Dolphins. The two combined for just 3 FP on the week. Malcolm Floyd kind of pulled his weight with five catches for 108 yards but he hasn&#8217;t found the end zone since week one and teammate Robert Meachem seems to be the favored WR in the red zone. Brandon Lloyd, starting in the flex for AJ, posted a measly 3 FP on just three catches. All the talk about the imminent breakout game is getting a little stale and through five games his high is just 11 FP. To add insult to injury three of AJ&#8217;s guys went down with serious injuries. Danny Amendola will miss roughly two months with a sternoclavdgjakjkdf (something with his collarbone and shoulder) injury, Alshon Jeffery has a fractured hand, and Jermichael Finley wrenched his shoulder. Maybe DeMarco Murray coming off a bye can get him back on track&#8230; maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Zak 113 (4-1); AJ 63 (1-4)</strong></p>
<h3>Hoop v. Max</h3>
<p><em>The Whole World Is A Couch v. Fuck You Aaron Sorkin</em></p>
<p>Looking at the numbers on this matchup it just seems impossible that Hoop won. Sure, Rodgers got 29. But he had just two other double digit guys plus a goose egg from a hobbled Jimmy Graham. Max had two guys post 20 FP and three guys notch 12 FP. Anyway, this contest went into Monday night with Max up 10 and just the Texans D/ST to go for Hoop. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsQXGMqmI2s">Bulls on Parade</a> slowly chipped away at Max&#8217;s lead, although they did surrender 17 points to the Jets which made this one interesting until the Jets last (meaningful) drive. The Texans sacked Sanchez with just around two minutes remaining to cut Max&#8217;s lead to 1, then intercepted him on the next down giving their D/ST unit 3 more points and handing Hoop the win. Ouch. But as much as Max complains about his team it&#8217;s really not that bad. He&#8217;s got the 1st and 3rd highest scoring receivers in fantasy (A.J. Green and Brandon Marshall), plus a top-10 back (Reggie Bush). Matt Forte will also likely finish in the top 15 at his position, and he also has a top-10 QB on his roster - the indomitable Alex Smith, who scored 34 FP this week. The colossal roadblock has been Chris Johnson. He ran roughshod over the stout Texans defense last week to the tune of 141 yards, but this week was stifled by Minnesota and gained just 24 yards on 15 carries with a fumble lost for a net -1 FP. Chris Johnson has been a special kind of horrible this year but it&#8217;s not all his fault. Really. <a href="http://footballoutsiders.com/stats/ol">According to FBO</a>, the Titans have the second worst offensive line in the league. Titans runs get stuffed (stopped at the line or for a loss) over a quarter of the time which is obviously terrible for Chis Johnson&#8217;s fantasy value. That same offensive line failed to adjust and pick up the saftey blitz on the play in which Jake Locker suffered his most recent shoulder injury which will likely cause him miss a second consecutive game. With aging veteran Hasselbeck slinging it and Kenny Britt a non-factor so far defenses can key on Johnson and make the Titans try to beat them down the field. Aside from Johnson Max&#8217;s team can make do, but unfortunately the Bears have a bye this week so he&#8217;ll probably struggle without Matt Forte and Brandon Marshall. On the other side, now that Rodgers is coming around (34 and 29 FP the last two weeks) Hoop might be able to bump up his weekly point total from the mid-90s to 100 or better. Frank Gore is running like a man possessed with 1 TD and double-digit points in four of his five games so far. He&#8217;s seventh in the league in rushing, tied for sixth in runs of 20+ yards, sixth in yards per attempt, and tied for second in rushing touchdowns. Frankly (no pun intended), he looks like an entirely different back than the worn-out guy wearing number 21 towards the end of last season and with the Niners&#8217; road grading offensive line he shows no signs of slowing down. On the other hand Adrian Peterson has been a little disappointing since his shocking 20 FP debut. He&#8217;s failed to exceed 12 FP since then and managed just 9 FP against the miserable Titans run defense which has surrendered huge games to lesser backs. Hoop trotted out the two tight end set this week and got burned - both Martellus Bennet and Jimmy Graham suffered injuries with their status for this week still unclear. Also of concern is Kenny Britt&#8217;s health, plus the failure to strike gold on any of the lottery ticket WRs Hoop drafted. But a rock star QB cures all ills&#8230; although Rodgers is facing the Texans this week. Anyway, I think both of these teams are generally strong but have definite holes to fill. Stay tuned. <em>(Aside to Max: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Engine_That_Could">Never give up!!!</a>)</em></p>
<p><strong>Hoop 90 (3-2); Max 88 (1-4)</strong></p>
<h3>Phil v. ZM</h3>
<p><em>The Bauce of Sauce v. Orange County Gunners</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s ridiculous that Phil is 3-2, and that he was just a <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=584667&amp;teamId=11&amp;scoringPeriodId=2&amp;seasonId=2012&amp;view=scoringperiod&amp;version=quick">point away</a> from being 4-1. He&#8217;s averaging just 76.4 points per week, the fewest in the league. For reference, the league average is 92.25, more than 15 points better <em>per week</em>. He&#8217;s also lucked out by having the fewest points scored against him with a weekly average of just 81.8. Still, he&#8217;s been outscored overall 382-409 AND has a winning record that includes a one-point loss! The Gods of averages will punish him eventually. Anyway&#8230; the Phil/ZM &#8220;matchup&#8221; this past week featured just five double digit scorers on both teams combined. Take away defenses and kickers and there were just two, Tom Brady and LeSean McCoy. ZM (well, more accurately, ESPN&#8217;s autodraft software) pinned his hopes on the Carolina Panthers, and the Panthers fucking suck. Some people thought Cam Newton would take a step forward this season and his dynamic play would improve all aspects of the Carolina offense. Other people (me) did not, but he&#8217;s regressed more than anyone really expected. Coming off a six point outing he&#8217;s ranked just 15th among fantasy QBs and he&#8217;s killing any chance of success ZM might have had. The two-headed backfield monster of DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart has been atrocious&#8230; if you <em>combined</em> their points you would have a mid-level RB2 ranked around 17th at the position and averaging 8.8 points per week. Steve Smith is way down at 34th among WRs with his trend pointing firmly down. Anyway, ZM&#8217;s team will be horribly thin this coming week with the Panthers on bye but it&#8217;s not like they were contributing much anyway. Oh, also, Andre Johnson has been baaaaaad (30th at WR, 7.6 average). ZM - get rid of Bernard Scott ASAP, he&#8217;s on IR. On the other side, Phil&#8217;s problem hasn&#8217;t been draft misses but rather injuries. Well, he did whiff on some draft picks but injuries are the larger concern. Aaron Hernandez was one of the huge buzz players in the run up to the fantasy season as the Patriots were reportedly reworking their offense around him to take advantage of personnel mismatches and his unique skill set. As noted in <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2012/10/08/patriots-huddle-relies-power-one/nHTapuVnBOwfFlffwTrN6J/story.html">this excellent article</a> he was supposed to be an integral part of the no-huddle attack the Patriots unveiled this year. Alas, he suffered a high ankle sprain week two against the Cardinals and has been sidelined since. He may see the field this week and while he probably won&#8217;t get a ton of snaps that&#8217;s good news for Phil. Greg Jennings has a nagging groin injury that has hobbled him on the field and led the Packers to scratch him from the week five lineup early last week. They hope he can get on the field against Houston but they&#8217;re also concerned about bringing him back too early and aggravating the injury given how ineffective Jennings has been playing though it so far this year. Phil did make a heads-up move securing Randall Cobb to shore up his receiving corps. Also interesting is Mikel Leshoure who is coming off a bye. He exploded for 19 FP in his debut but was stifled by the Vikings the following week (13 carries, 26 yards, 2 FP). But the Vikings look increasingly like one of the better run-stopping units in the league and if Leshoure shines going forward he&#8217;ll plug one of two gaping holes at running back. Those two spots are currently occupied by Jackie Battle, who&#8217;s now firmly in a back-up role, and Steven Jackson, who hasn&#8217;t found the end zone or a double-digit outing so far this year and is gaining just 3.5 YPC. Jackson has apparently been playing through some sort of injury but is now healthy. What this all adds up to is that Phil&#8217;s team could improve from lucky to pretty decent over the next few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Phil 67 (3-2); ZM 49 (1-4)</strong></p>
<h3>Jenny v. Pat</h3>
<p><em>Sharing 1st W 3 People Sucks v. Town Taxes</em></p>
<p>Pat made the switch to Dalton last week and it served him well but the Red Rocket sputtered this week with just 234 yards, 1 TD and 2 picks for 11 FP. He&#8217;s still 8th among fantasy quarterbacks thanks to three straight outings of 24+ but looking at his numbers this year he seems like a guy who lights up bad defenses (Cleveland, Washington, Jacksonville) but struggles against good ones (Miami, Baltimore). It was a minor miracle that this one was even close with Dalton struggling and Megatron on bye. In fact, if not for a stunning performance by Marques Colston, Pat would have walked away with a W. Colston took advantage of Jimmy Graham and Darren Sproles ineffectiveness and hauled in nine balls for 131 yards and <em>three</em> touchdowns (31 FP) against the Chargers. Colston&#8217;s monster performance, a nice 25 FP from Eli and 19 from the Baltimore Ballhawks papered over what was otherwise an uninspiring performance by the rest of Jenny&#8217;s team. Ray Rice managed just 11 FP against the miserable Chiefs run defense. Nate Washington, Jeremy Maclin, and Rob Gronkowski scored 3, 3, and 4 respectively. Kicker Mason Crosby missed both his field goal attempts and put up just 1. Still Jenny was up going into Monday (I could&#8217;ve sworn it was 95-91 but it&#8217;s 97-91 now and I don&#8217;t see anything on the stat correction page) and made a veteran move: she benched Shonn Greene. Two seasons ago Jenny was up against Pat, nursing a lead going into MNF with the Redskins D/ST still to go for her and Pat&#8217;s team all finished up. Long story short: <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=301115028">this happened</a> and the Washington D/ST scored -10 FP which cost Jenny the matchup. Greene theoretically could have fumbled this one away, hence the benching. On Pat&#8217;s squad he unfortunately had three seesaw guys go against him on the same week. Check out the numbers for Marshawn Lynch, Dwayne Bowe, and Roddy White so far this year by week:</p>
<p>Lynch: 9, 18, 9, 20, 8<br/> Bowe: 5, 22, 7, 16, 6<br/> White: 8, 16, 5, 28, 6</p>
<p>In week 2 that trio notched 56 combined and in week 4 they posted a ludicrous 64 FP, but contributed just 20 this week. Pat&#8217;s record is now 2-3&#8230; care to guess in which weeks he got his two wins? On the plus side Alfred Morris has been fantastic, Tony Gonzalez leads all fantasy tight ends by a healthy margin, and Pat picked up the Vikings D/ST which has been stellar. Gonzalez is leading all NFL players in receptions (39) and the guy is 36 years old playing a position which requires him to go over the middle frequently. What a fucking stud! Still, he needs more consistency out of his core guys if he hopes to get back to .500 and eventually into the playoffs.</p>
<h3>Nick v. Dave</h3>
<p><em>Charlie&#8217;s $150 Dick Rash v. That&#8217;s No Moon</em></p>
<p>Given the explosivness of RG3 (20+ FP every previous game) I&#8217;m pretty lucky he got his bell rung on Sunday and left the game after registering just 3 FP (not that I was happy about the injury or anything). Anyway, as well as RG3 has been playing, the story of Dave&#8217;s season to this point is the Bears D/ST, not the rookie quarterback. Dave&#8217;s first victory came in a 60-59 clusterfuck against Phil. But his next two wins were largely driven by the Chicago defense. In his 100-93 win over Pat that defense contributed a full 25 points and led his team in scoring. The following week he beat Ali like a red-headed stepchild with the Bears D/ST again leading his team in points, this time with 29 which just happened to be the exact margin of victory. In their most recent outing they posted a staggering 31, pacing Dave&#8217;s squad the third consecutive week. What this unit has been doing is incredibly impressive&#8230; but it can&#8217;t last. This season the Bears have 17 takeaways, tops in the league, and 10 of those have come over the last three games. Nine of those 10 were interceptions and <em>five</em> were returned for touchdowns. Lance Briggs and Charles Tillman set an NFL record by becoming the first teammates to both score defensive touchdowns in back-to-back games, a record which I have to think will stand until the end of time or until the concussion crisis kills the NFL, whichever comes first. From a fantasy perspective (remember, with our scoring system) they are tied for third in overall points with 114 (22.8 average). That&#8217;s behind just Drew Brees and Matt Ryan and ahead of Brady and Rodgers. A DEFENSE! But these numbers came against some not-great quarterbacks and offenses. First they had Andrew Luck in his NFL debut. That was followed by Aaron Rodgers and the Packers, against whom the Bears D/ST had their lowest scoring game (10 FP). The next week they began their current torrid streak against the Rams, followed by Dallas, then Jacksonville. The Bears might be the best team in the NFC North and a good portion of the credit should go to the defense, which actually outscored St. Louis and Jacksonville by itself. Still, this can&#8217;t last. Obviously taking turnovers to the house is fluky, but turnovers themselves are pretty random too. Sure, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaine_Gabbert">certain</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Fitzpatrick">people</a> are more likely to make mistakes than others but fumble recoveries are essentially a coin flip and not every poor throw is picked off. Plus the Bears will probably start to give up more points eventually, especially against the offenses in their division which are all pretty good or should be eventually. Aside from the Bears D/ST and RG3, Dave&#8217;s lynchpins have been his running backs. Stevan Ridley and Trent Richardson (18 FP each this week) are both having excellent seasons and they are sitting at 4th and 6th respectively at their position in fantasy points. Stevan Ridley has diversified New England&#8217;s offense making it more dangerous than ever. Richardson is making a splash as both a runner and pass-catcher in an offense that has few other threats. The disappointing position on his roster is clearly receiver, with Jordy Nelson and Larry Fitzgerald having only three double-digit outings combined. He&#8217;s also been struggling at tight end - the Antonio Gates comeback tour apparently exploded on the runway. He has yet to exceed 5 FP and obviously hasn&#8217;t seen the end zone this season. Dave did grab James Jones who has caught two TDs each of the last two weeks, but that kind of output won&#8217;t last long. When Greg Jennings eventually gets healthy his value will drop like a stone. On top of that, potential flex play Donald Brown had a minor knee surgery and will sit for at least a couple weeks. As for my team&#8230; well they looked pretty good. Although Matt Ryan had his lowest total of the season with 19 FP he&#8217;s still thrown for two or more touchdowns in every game so far this year. Speaking of the Falcons, the receiver seesaw I mentioned above tilted Julio Jones&#8217;s way this week – he had 10 grabs for 94 yards and a score. It&#8217;s a little disconcerting to see fewer long passes to Jones but if that&#8217;s what it takes to bump up his target total I&#8217;m fine with it. Arian Foster had his best outing yet with 22 FP (152 rush yards, 16 receiving yards, and a rushing score) and now leads all running backs by a substantial margin. Ryan Mathews finally escaped the Norv Turner doghouse and abused the miserable New Orleans defense to the tune of 12 carries for 80 yards and a score, along with six catches for 59 yards (19 FP). But the biggest daps go to Reggie Wayne who cemented his place in the nightmares of Green Bay&#8217;s secondary with 27 FP on the day. The Pack simply could not find an answer for Wayne, giving up 13 catches, 212 yards, and the game-winning touchdown. He&#8217;s now third in the NFL in receiving yards despite having played one fewer game than any of the other top receivers besides Megatron. In yards per game he&#8217;s way out in front with 126.5; Calvin Johnson is at 105.8 in second place. He&#8217;s also leading the league in targets with 60 and is fifth in receptions with 35. And remember – he&#8217;s played one less game! On the other hand my struggles with the flex spot and tight end continued. Torrey Smith is wildly inconsistent and I&#8217;m inclined to put a lot of the blame on the strange gameplans Baltimore trots out. I mean shit, they&#8217;re supposed to be one of the best teams in the AFC and they let fucking Kansas City hang around all afternoon? The Chiefs had Brady Quinn out there throwing passes! Whatever. Anyway, Smith may be riding the bench for a little while as Rashard Mendenhall is back in action. In his first outing since going down with a torn ACL in the final week of the 2011 regular season he ran well, with 14 carries for 81 yards and a score. While my team&#8217;s 131-point outburst set the season high for our league, I will note that my guys had great matchups, with almost everyone going up against a defense terrible versus their position.</p>
<p><strong>Nick 131 (4-1); Dave 105 (3-2)</strong></p>
