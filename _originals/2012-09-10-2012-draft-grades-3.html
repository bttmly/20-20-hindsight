<p>This is kind of unfair. These three guys had to autodraft all or part of their teams, and obviously might have made different decisions if they were able to <a href="http://www.thatvideosite.com/v/610">do it live.</a> But I&#8217;m not above taking cheap shots so let's get down to business.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<h3>Patrick</h3>
<p>Pat was able to do his first three picks at work; the rest were autodrafted.</p>
<h4>Round 1: Calvin Johnson</h4>
<p>Let me start by saying that Calvin Johnson is the best receiver on the planet. Right now in the NFL nobody comes even close. That said, I&#8217;m not a big fan of taking a receiver in the first round (yes, I got burned by Andre Johnson last year). Megatron has no significant injury baggage and put together one of the best receiving seasons in recent memory last year. But a defense committed to stopping a single player can accomplish that most effectively against a receiver. Even when the box is loaded a back has the offensive line to try to clear space, and quarterbacks can direct their throws to where the defense is weakest. However, receivers have to work largely on their own (crossing routes, etc. aside) and Calvin Johnson was so dominant last season that secondaries will pay attention to little else when facing the Lions. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX0JjyTgme0"> Here&#8217;s the Saints lining up two DBs across from Megatron last year</a>, and while most teams won&#8217;t go that far safeties will be helping on his side constantly. Of course, he can still do shit like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLLsqztAAPI">this</a> so he should have another excellent season. Still, Ray Rice was on the board and given the the shortage of true RB1s this year I can&#8217;t say I love taking Megatron at that spot.</p>
<h4>Round 2: Marshawn Lynch</h4>
<p>Lynch exploded back onto the fantasy radar last season with his impressive performance. Starting in week four he scored a touchdown in 11 straight games with six 100+ rushing yard games over that span. But he was underwhelming at best in the two seasons prior, although he has over 1000 rushing yards in three of his five pro seasons. He&#8217;s just 26 and is one of the few guys in the league who won&#8217;t be sharing carries this year. There was really no other pick to make here, and indeed the next five backs off the board all have question marks next to them.</p>
<h4>Round 3: Roddy White</h4>
<p>Roddy White led the NFL in targets last season with a whopping 181 balls thrown his way. While the Falcons have made it clear they plan to shift some of those targets to Julio Jones, White is still about as safe as it gets for a wide receiver. The next two wideouts off the board, Victor Cruz and A.J. Green, both have just a one year track record of success whereas White is sitting on a streak of five straight 1150+ receiving yard seasons.</p>
<h4>Round 4: Tony Romo</h4>
<p>Here&#8217;s where the autodrafting began and it&#8217;s pretty obvious. Romo is definitely a solid quarterback and his performance in the Wednesday night opener was a gem. On the other hand, broadcasters noted that performance (22-for-29 passing for 307 yards, 3 touchdowns and a pick) might be the best performance of his career, which should indicate he is good but not great. After all, that&#8217;s just a notch or two better than an average performance from an elite quarterback. But at least for week one Romo did his job for fantasy owners. Still, his star receivers are constant question marks; Miles Austin might burst a hammy at any moment and Dez Bryant is&#8230; Dez Bryant. With his touchdown security blanket Laurent Robinson gone to Jacksonville, Romo clearly hopes Kevin Ogletree can fill in. If Ogletree plays week-in week-out like he did Wednesday, Romo&#8217;s prayers have been answered. Still, even if you&#8217;re risk averse, there were better options at QB still on the board, especially Philip Rivers who went a whole round later. Then again there&#8217;s a decent chance I&#8217;ll be eating my words come December.</p>
<h4>Round 5: Michael Vick</h4>
<p>Ouch&#8230; back-to-back quarterbacks in rounds four and five. A ton of wide receiver and running back talent came off the board in those two rounds. Looks like Pat&#8217;s going to play the matchup game for the time being and wait for trade offers on one of these guys. They&#8217;re too valuable to keep both and I expect someone will make an offer before too long, but to recoup the value he&#8217;ll need to get a top 20 WR or top 25 RB. Good luck.</p>
<h4>Round 6: Dwayne Bowe</h4>
<p>Bowe is a highly talented receiver with a mediocre quarterback so we&#8217;ll see if he can make lemons into lemonade this season. The Chiefs&#8217; thunder (Peyton Hillis) and lightning (Jamaal Charles) running back combo could take some pressure off the passing game so I think there&#8217;s a decent shot Bowe outperforms his draft spot this season. Not a bad pick for autodraft, but this still left Pat with just one running back entering the seventh round. On the other hand, the next RB off the board after this was Jonathan Stewart who is locked in the worst RBBC (running back by committee) situation in the league.</p>
<h4>Later Rounds</h4>
<p>With Cedric Benson in the seventh Pat picked up a guy who won&#8217;t be sharing carries (at least early in the year). On the other hand, despite the shock and awe passing attack the Packers have fielded over the past two seasons their running backs have fared poorly. Benson could be the one to change that, but it seems like a pass-catching back might be a better fit for this system (Benson has exceeded 20 catches in a season only once). Autodraft snagged Roy Helu, Tony Gonzalez, and Michael Crabtree in the eighth through 10th rounds. Obviously Gonzalez is a HOFer, but the other two are guys you&#8217;ll always feel uncomfortable starting. They&#8217;ll each have big outings this year it&#8217;s just impossible to know quite when. With another two QBs (Dalton and Palmer) in the 12th and 13th, Pat got stuck with an overstocked quarterback position while missing the opportunity to go after the high upside guys most people were targeting, although he did finish with Jon Baldwin who could fit that role.</p>
<p>While not an atrocious roster, having four quarterbacks killed Pat&#8217;s depth at key positions. He&#8217;s got four running backs but one is currently a clear second-stringer and another is riding the Shanahan Running Back Merry-Go-Round every week. Bye weeks could be tough if he&#8217;s not able make trades, something which our league has been very hesitant to do for the past two years.</p>
<p><strong>FINAL GRADE: C+</strong></p>
<h3>ZM</h3>
<p>ZM pre-ranked his players and left the rest up to the mysterious ESPN/Skynet/Robocop hybrid that conducts the autodraft.</p>
<h4>LeSean McCoy</h4>
<p>Given ESPN&#8217;s default rankings ZM must have moved McCoy ahead of Foster and Rice, so I hope he&#8217;s happy with that pick. I&#8217;m certainly glad he thinks McCoy will be the highest scoring running back this year beacuse I definitely don&#8217;t.</p>
<h4>Round 2: Cam Newton</h4>
<p>I do not like this pick at all. I mentioned some of the things I think point to a steep decline in Cam&#8217;s fantasy production in <a href="http://20-20hindsight.tumblr.com/2012/08/20/2012-quarterbacks-preview.html/2012-quarterbacks-preview-this-preview-will-cover">this post</a> and I&#8217;ll go over some of them again. First, Cam had the most statistically staggering season of any rookie quarterback ever with over 4,000 yards passing and 35 total touchdowns. Teams just didn&#8217;t see him coming, but they started to figure him out a little in the second half of the year. While Cam&#8217;s touchdown production was pretty even over the season his passing numbers took a dive in the last eight games. Over that period he averaged 207 yards a game and 6.7 YPA; those numbers were 299 and 7.7 in the first half. Teams know Cam can throw and they&#8217;ll defend accordingly. I also think we&#8217;ll see a huge drop in the number of rushing touchdowns he scores this season (although his passing scores might creep up slightly). First, regression: he broke the record for season rushing touchdowns by a quarterback last season and it&#8217;s a bad bet to think he&#8217;ll match or exceed that total. Moreover, the Panthers brought in Mike Tolbert who will presumably be their short-yardage and goal line specialist. When Tolbert was on the Chargers he was a nightmare for fantasy owners, as he seemed to get all the touchdowns while Ryan Mathews gathered all the yards, making neither particularly attractive. Expect him to similarly poach Cam&#8217;s fantasy value. After all, would you rather send the charismatic face of your franchise (and first overall pick to boot) into a mess at the goal line, or the third best running back on your team? Cam had 15 carries inside the five-yard line last year and converted eight for touchdowns. If he he has half that number of tries this year I&#8217;ll be surprised.</p>
<h4>Round 3: Andre Johnson</h4>
<p>Another pick I don&#8217;t like, and I&#8217;ll freely admit it&#8217;s personal. Andre Johnson is the main reason I spent so much time over the past six weeks doing fantasy research. I came into last season without much preparation, drafted Andre Johnson in the first round, and paid for it for the rest of the season. With fantasy football&#8217;s incredible popularity and the explosion of coverage surrounding it, it was inevitable that number crunchers would start examining at the anecodotal concept of an &#8220;injury prone&#8221; player. The initial analyses purport show that <a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/nfl/2012/08/29/are-players-actually-injury-prone-or-are-we-just-making-it-all-up/">injury prone-ness doesn&#8217;t really exist</a>. (Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m coming around to a point here eventually.) Rather, that the widespread belief in injury prone-ness among fantasy owners and even media analysts is the result of a well-known (to psychologists at least) cognitive biases. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic">Here</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">are</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy">just</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_correlation">a</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias">few</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_cascade">relevant</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring">examples</a> - more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">here</a>. This seems plausible enough with one major caveat: all injuries are not created equal. As I&#8217;m obviously not a medical professional I can&#8217;t state this with a high degree of confidence (so again, I may be falling victim to cognitive bias) but from what I&#8217;ve read there is evidence that at least concussions and soft tissue injuries can increase susceptibility to those same injuries later. (Seriously, I&#8217;ll get back to Andre Johnson at some point.) In the first link above Ryan Mathews is mentioned as a player typically seen as injury prone. Over the past two years, he&#8217;s been <a href="http://www.kffl.com/player/22291/nfl/injury_history/ryan-mathews">listed as questionable or doubtful</a> with injuries to the ankle, groin, and calf. In the preseason this year he broke his clavacle. It doesn&#8217;t seem like injuries to completely unrelated body parts months or years earlier contributed to him breaking his collar bone. Alright, so this whole injury prone thing is probably at least a little overblown. But I still hate Andre Johnson, and it&#8217;s still personal but I&#8217;ll try to justify it with real reasons.</p>
<p>First, the Texans throw it less often than any other team in the league. Second, Johnson doesn&#8217;t have a credible receiving threat playing across from him. Third, Matt Schaub is a pretty good quarterback but it&#8217;s quite possible he&#8217;s still not back to 100% after his Lisfranc injury from week 10 last year. The injury occured in mid-November 2011 and these can take <a href="http://www.footeducation.com/lisfranc-injury-fracture-midfoot-sprain">a year or more</a> to fully heal. Finally, while injury prone-ness may be a load of bullshit, I&#8217;d like to see a study on injury recovery times, becuase Johnson&#8217;s injuries sure seem to linger. He was on the injury report with a knee injury nine times in 2007. He didn&#8217;t appear on the report at all the next year and began his two year stretch of dominance; he appeared only twice on the injury report in 2009. Then in 2010 he was listed with an ankle injury a whopping 13 times and in 2011 including playoffs he was listed 14 times. So while he may not suffer a whole bunch of individual injuries, but when he does it lasts forever. Plus he&#8217;s 31 this year. No thank you.</p>
<h4>Round 4: Mike Wallace</h4>
<p>I really like the Wallace/Brown receiving duo. Like, a lot. I&#8217;ll commit now to writing a mid-season post comparing the premiere receiver duos in the NFL. I think Jones/White will have the best stats, followed by Jennings/Nelson, Welker/Lloyd then Wallace/Brown. Yes, Wallace/Brown ahead of Nicks/Cruz. Actually, bump the Steelers&#8217; pair above the Patriots&#8217;. Now were getting off topic, but which pair do you think has better numbers at the end of the season: Gronk/Hernandez or Welker/Lloyd? Alright, back to Mike Wallace. He&#8217;s real good at football. But holdouts can screw up an entire season. It takes time to get in sync with the offense, and the Steelers are implementing a new scheme this year. I think Wallace will have a rough time over the first few weeks but he&#8217;ll put the pieces together eventually, probably right around the time defenses begin to think Antonio Brown is the only guy they have to worry about it. Still, I don&#8217;t love him in the fourth round. Quote me on it: Antonio Brown will have a better year.</p>
<h4>Round 5: Steve Smith</h4>
<p>Steve Smith is old. Cam Newton will regress a little this year. Carolina will run it more than some people expect (they&#8217;re paying DeAngelo Williams, Jonathan Stewart and Mike Tolbert a combined $7.3 million this year). I think Maclin or Harvin would be better with this pick.</p>
<h4>Later Rounds</h4>
<p>Jonathan Stewart in the sixth. ZM is all in on the Panthers offense. Yikes. Vincent Jackson in the eighth might pay off; the Bucs paid him a boatload of money so they better throw a lot of balls his way. Beanie Wells should do alright until he goes down with injury (cognitive bias!). The rest of his robodraft was boring. Kickers back-to-back in the last two rounds? Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>FINAL GRADE: C</strong></p>
<h3>Brian</h3>
<p>My theory is Brian came up with his team name then customized his rankings to make sure he&#8217;d be able to use it. There&#8217;s a lot to dislike about this roster, hence the grade. But anything can happen in the NFL, and Fred Jackson&#8217;s week one injury makes Brian&#8217;s team about 50% better (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_bias">this</a>). I&#8217;m going to look like such an asshole when Brian smokes me by 40 points when we go head-to-head. Seriously, if things go right this squad could actually be dangerous. Well, if you go up against Brian when the Raiders are playing a cupcake defense.</p>
<p><strong>FINAL GRADE: D</strong></p>
