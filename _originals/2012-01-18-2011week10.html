<p><em><span id="internal-source-marker_0.7718683268749512"></span><span id="internal-source-marker_0.7718683268749512"></span>Originally posted 11/15/11</em><br/><span></span><br/><span>Week 10 was loaded with surprises in the NFL. First, all four NFC West teams won their games. The Niners advanced to 8-1 with a big win over one of the few challenging opponents on their second-half schedule, and did so in convincing fashion while missing Frank Gore for most of the game. Of the 49ers seven remaining games, five are against the AFC West, with the other two coming against the Steelers and Ravens. While both teams defend the run well, the Niners have shown they can keep up with anybody.</span><br/><span></span><!-- more --><br/><span>Else where in the NFC West&#8230; The Rams won a snoozer over the Browns 13-12, although the blame should be laid at the feet of the Browns field goal unit which botched a 22-yard attempt at the end of the game. The Cardinals, with some guy named John Skelton under center, knocked off a reeling Eagles team to effectively end Philly&#8217;s long-shot playoff aspirations. And the Baltimore Ravens shit the bed against the Seahawks, turning the ball over three times in a huge letdown game after sealing their ownership of the tiebreaker with Pittsburgh last week.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>In the AFC, Denver is now 3-1 in the Tim Tebow era. This despite Tebow going 2-8 passing for 69 yards. The Broncos ran the ball a ludicrous 55 times, and though Tebow did have one perfect TD pass to Eric Decker he looked awful throwing the ball for most of the game. Still, a win is a win. Here&#8217;s an interesting AFC West stat: all four teams have a net negative point differential on the season so far.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>Then there were these lopsided that wins gave some clarity as to the quality of certain teams going forward&#8230;</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>- Chicago looks to be surging just as divisional rival Detroit is stumbling. The Bears demolished the Lions 37-13, and after the game Lions QB Matt Stafford revealed that the index finger of his throwing hand is broken. Ouch. In addition, Stafford may be slapped with a fine sometime this week, following his helmet-grabbing tackle of a blocker after he threw his fourth INT of the game. The tackle and subsequent retaliation sparked a late brawl, with the Lions venting some frustration at their own patchy performance. An earlier incident between Lions DT Suh and Bears QB Cutler, in which Suh ripped Cutler&#8217;s helmet off while tackling him, kept the tension level high throughout the contest.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>- Houston continued to roll, knocking aside Tampa Bay in a 37-9 thumping. They are trying to run away with the AFC South but the Titans are hanging around 1.5 games back. The Texans have the best point differential in the NFL through week 10, with +107. They have won 4 straight, despite missing star receiver Andre Johnson. However, reports are now surfacing that Matt Schaub suffered a &#8220;significant&#8221; foot injury on Sunday that will cause him to miss &#8220;several&#8221; weeks. The Texans have a week 11 bye but head coach Gary Kubiak has already stated that backup Matt Leinart will start for the Texans week 12 against the Jags. Leinart has 14 career TDs against 20 picks in 29 games played, so we&#8217;ll see if the Texans can continue to shine with him taking snaps.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>- Speaking of the Titans, they blew past the Panthers 30-3 as the Panthers failed to score a touchdown all season. Chris Johnson finally showed some signs of life; he piled up 174 yards from scrimmage and rushed for a TD.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>- Despite missing star receiver Miles Austin, Dallas quieted some skeptics this week by trampling Buffalo 44-7. Fill-in receiver Laurent Robinson had 2 TD catches while Dez Bryant had one of his own. Buffalo looks to be sagging back into mediocrity, although they are still tied with the Jets for second in the AFC East. The Cowboys, meanwhile, got some help from the Niners and are now just one game behind the Giants. They are +41 for points this season while NYG is just +7, and the Giants have a history of second-half collapses. Stay tuned.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>- Speaking of the Jets, their so-called &#8220;momentum&#8221; wasn&#8217;t enough to stop the Patriots. After dropping two straight, many were wondering weather New England had what it takes to make another deep playoff run. Yet they went to the Meadowlands and quieted their critics with a solid performance from their inexperienced defense.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>There were also some substantial injuries that will bear close watching during the week ahead&#8230;</span><br/><span></span><br/><span>But now for the fantasy action:</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>BREH 108 (6-4); MS 44 (4-6)</span></strong><br/><span>Despite Michael Vick&#8217;s struggles, Pat&#8217;s squad put together an impressive performance. He piled up 58 points from his tight end (23), defense (20) and kicker (15). That alone would have been more than enough to bury AJ this week, who turned in a league-wide season low performance of just 44 points. Pat lucked out on both the matchup and the incredible play of the bottom of his roster; Wes Welker and Calvin Johnson combined for a meager 10 points, while Michael Vick was only able to grab 8. Ben Tate has continued to impress in his role as the Texans second option at RB, and Dez Bryant reached double digits as well with 73 receiving yards and a score. AJ had just one player, Cam Newton, get in to double digits. Newton did not score a TD for the first time this season. The rest of his roster was similarly disappointing.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>TWS 136 (10-0); SPAU 89 (4-5-1)</span></strong><br/><span>Max&#8217;s team had another stellar sunday, led by Arian Foster, who ran roughshod over a crumbling Tampa Bay defense. Tim Tebow, despite a miserable passing day still had 18, thanks to two total TDs. Demarco Murray continued his to dazzle in Dallas, grabbing 171 total yards and a score. This overshadowed Matt Forte&#8217;s second underwhelming game in a row. Though he did find the end zone, he managed only 64 yards on 18 carries and caught a single pass for 3 yards. However with the Bears playing with a lead all game, he wasn&#8217;t called on to do much besides run the clock out. Andre&#8217;s team was solid this week but didn&#8217;t have the gaudy numbers that Max was able to pile up. Chris Johnson posted by far his best game of the season, grabbing 23 points as the Titans steamrolled the Panthers. Rashard Mendenhall scored twice, and David Akers was outstanding for the Niners. But the struggles began with Matt Stafford, whose four picks were disastrous for the Lions; two were returned for scores.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>TUSK 67 (7-3); HUH? 53 (4-6)</span></strong><br/><span>I cannot believe Phil escaped with a win this week. The core of his lineup, his three highly touted receivers, combined for just three points. Stevie Johnson posted a goose egg – he had 42 in the Bills&#8217; first three games but has just 29 in the six games since then. Dwayne Bowe was only able to grab two passes for a total of 17 yards, and things look to go from bad to worse for him – Cassel will likely miss the rest of the season with a hand injury. His third, and most explosive receiver, Vincent Jackson, had just one catch for 22 yards. Luckily Drew Brees had yet another great game, throwing for 322 yards, 2 TD and no picks. Jimmy Graham picked up 14 of his own. For Ali, Darren Sproles&#8217; donut was the clincher as he&#8217;s been one of Ali&#8217;s top producers this season. Furthermore, Fred Jackson failed to hit double digits for the second straight week; he also lost a fumble for the second consecutive game. And the decision to start the Jets defense against the Patriots? Let&#8217;s call it questionable and leave it there.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>MARC 100 (4-6); DEM 95 (4-5-1)</span></strong><br/><span>This narrow loss hurt, especially with Marshawn Lynch sitting on the bench with 21. A running back putting 21 on the Ravens is just silly. Plus Jordan had two donuts! Damn it. Julio Jones is hurt again, so now he will be joining my other star receivers Miles Austin and Andre Johnson on the bench. For Jordan, Reggie Bush and Larry Fitzgerald had 42 together, while the Cowboys D/ST had 18 and Mario Manningham had 13. Rivers had a was able to put up 18 despite another two turnovers. On my squad, Matty Ice had a big day with 24, and Laurent Robinson continued to amaze with two touchdown grabs and 73 yards receiving. I waited the entire game for Jermichael Finley to grab a TD but he never found the end zone and I ended up 5 points short.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>ZAK 120 (2-8); JUIC 89 (4-6)</span></strong><br/><span>Zak finally got back on track with big performances from a number of key guys. MJD had his best game of the season with 19, and Brady finally matched his early season performances with 31. However the breakout star here was Michael Bush, who ran roughshod over the Chargers for a stunning 29. Also pitching in were the Texans D/ST and New England kicker Stephen Gostkowski who each had 15. ZM had a disappointing outing, with only one of his backs or receivers breaking double digits (LeSean McCoy with 15). Sanchez had a solid outing with 21, despite throwing two picks, and New Orleans kicker John Kasay had a big 17, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to top Brady and Bush.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>WILL 70 (7-3); LINC 62 (3-7)</span></strong><br/><span>Dave went in to MNF with 25. Seriously. And he won. Rodgers passed for 4 TDs for the third time this season, having one of his best games yet. And GB kicker Mason Crosby got 9. And that was basically it – nobody besides Rodgers got double digits and two of Dave&#8217;s big stars (DeSean Jackson and Frank Gore) had donuts. Jenny&#8217;s team was even worse though; her five receivers and backs totaled 23. Schaub was decent but the Texans glitzy offense has been relying on Foster and Tate, rather than Schaub&#8217;s arm. Plus Schaub sustained a foot injury that will end his season. This would have been a great opportunity for someone to gain a game on Dave&#8217;s playoff spot but it just didn&#8217;t turn out that way.</span></p>
