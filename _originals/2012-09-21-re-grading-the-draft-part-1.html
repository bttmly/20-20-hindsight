<p>I’ll start by thanking the guys at 3106 Doctor Martin Luther King Junior Way for hosting an awesome Draft session, it was a ton of fun. Drafting is almost the best part of fantasy football but only if you can get everyone in the same room. Who doesn’t like to get instant feedback on waiting till the third round to draft your first running back? Which for me was a panic stricken Trent Richardson pick! Because when your first option at that spot is taken the pick before you, who needs a plan B? I somehow decided I’d grab the guy I’d already crossed off my list after telling myself “I will not be the person to draft THAT guy”. The best way I can describe my immediate reaction to my own pick would be this….</p>

<p>Yet to my absolute unadulterated delight I log on here to find I’ve been praised for my draft! I guess waiting until the last 10 seconds each round to NOT draft the highest ranked players on my board paid off. Can’t wait to see where Nick ranks Max! I sure enjoyed his Witten pick in the 9th. That was fun. Football starts tonight! Get ready, cause this Death Star has no holes!</p>
