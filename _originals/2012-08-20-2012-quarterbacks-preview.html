<p>This preview will cover four distinct tiers of quarterbacks. The first tier is simply the best quarterbacks in the game, players who (barring injury) will almost certainly have excellent fantasy season. The next group is a little different: they offer the huge upside with considerable risk, but one or more of them could end up among the best fantasy quarterbacks of the season if things go right. The third group are your week-in week-out workhorses who consistently put up solid numbers. Here the risk is far lower, but so is the ceiling. You know what you get with them. The last group are players at some sort of crossroads, and it’s not clear if they’re on the way up, on the way down, or just settling into serviceable mediocrity.</p>

<h3>The Best</h3>
<p><br/><strong>Tom Brady</strong><br/> &#8230;is the best quarterback in the NFL. Here are some of Brady’s most impressive records: most touchdowns in a single season (50), the most consecutive passes without an interception (358), and the highest career win rate (78%) in the Super Bowl era. He&#8217;s only missed significant time due to injury in one season (2008), and since that injury he&#8217;s posted two of the top three seasons of his career. Out of 144 games from 2002-2011, excepting 2008, he&#8217;s started every one. And in the first season in which he started an NFL game, he won the Super Bowl. The 2012 Patriots have a prototypical duo of tight ends, one of the best space players in the game in Wes Welker, and have brought in a potentially devastating deep threat with Brandon Lloyd. As usual the sky’s the limit for Tom Brady and the New England offense.<br/><br/><strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong><br/> &#8230;is the best quarterback in the NFL. He holds a career 3.5 TD/INT ratio, by far the best in NFL history. While the Packers struggled somewhat during his first year as a starter, he still threw for over 4,000 yards and 28 touchdowns. Since that season, he has a 76% win percentage. He is coming off a season in which he set the NFL record for passer rating (122.5), <em>averaged</em> three passing touchdowns per game (45 in 15 games played), and led the Packers to a 15-1 regular season record in perhaps the toughest division in the NFL. The 2012 Packers have one of the strongest wideout tandems in the league with Greg Jennings and Jordy Nelson, plus a number of speedy receivers further down the chart, such as Randall Cobb. This offense was unstoppable last year even with minimal contributions from Jermichael Finley, who has the size and length to break into the upper echelon of tight ends. Tight end play and the running game can only improve&#8230; and again, they already had the best offense in the NFL last year.<br/><br/><strong>Drew Brees</strong><br/> &#8230;is the best quarterback in the NFL. In 2011 he smashed the single-season passing yards record which had stood since 1984. He holds the record for highest career completion percentage (min. 2,500 att. – 65.9%) and highest single-season completion percentage (71.2%). This year he will take aim at Johnny Unitas&#8217;s record of 47 consecutive games with at least one passing touchdown; his current streak is at 43. He has thrown for 5+ touchdowns in a single game seven different times. He&#8217;s the only player to throw for 250 yards or more in every game in a season, which he accomplished last year. In 13 of those 16 games he threw for 300+, and his season average was over 340. He has the highest career average passing yards per game at 263.7. The 2012 Saints lost Robert Meachem, but that might be a good thing for a team with too many mouths (well, hands) to feed already. Last year Darren Sproles sketched out a new prototype for speedy hybrid offensive player who can line up in the backfield or split out, and is extremely difficult to tackle in space. This development allowed the Saints offense to be deadly at every passing depth: Sproles usually underneath, Graham in the mid-level, and Colston over the top. Further, Graham and Sproles both present matchup problems for defenses and having them on the field together multiplies this effect. Expect Drew Brees to take full advantage.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>High Risk, High Reward</h3>
<p><br/><strong>Cam Newton</strong><br/> His monster rookie season established a new prototype for a mobile quarterback where superior athletic ability trumps almost every other consideration. He also smashed the rookie season passing yards record set by Peyton Manning along with the record for most rushing touchdowns in a season by a quarterback, rookie or otherwise. That said, he plays an extremely aggressive style of football with limited offensive weapons, and as defenses began to figure him out towards the end of the 2011 season his numbers sagged noticeably. In five of his last six outings he threw for under 210 yards, and he was below 175 in the three final games of the season (although the Panthers won two of those). Newton will not match last season’s rushing touchdown performance, especially with the Panthers adding bruising goal line back Mike Tolbert. The question is, can he improve in the passing game? And, more importantly, will his full-throttle style of play land him on the injury report?<br/><br/><strong>Matt Stafford</strong><br/> If Cam Newton established a new baseline for freakish athletes playing quarterback, then Matt Stafford is the posterboy for a new generation of quarterbacks who enter the NFL nearly pro-ready. While Stafford’s Lions struggled to a 2-8 record in the games he started his first year, the franchise was integrating a rookie QB, a first-time head coach in his first year on the job, and a number of other offensive rookies. Stafford would miss the final six games of that season due to a knee injury, and the following year he only made it three games before suffering a season-ending injury to his throwing shoulder. With his checkered injury history and the Lions’ struggles (despite three top-two picks between 2007 and 2010) there was intense scrutiny on the 2011 team, and Stafford delivered despite less than a full season of NFL game experience. He posted one of only five 5,000+ passing yards seasons in NFL history, threw a staggering 41 touchdowns, and anchored one of the most surprising and electrifying offenses in the league. But questions remain. One great season does not an elite quarterback make, and injury susceptibility could still be a concern. But most important, were the colossal numbers put up by the top quarterbacks in 2011 an aberration or did they mark a tectonic shift in the NFL landscape? Moreover, if multiple quarterbacks approaching 5,000 yards a season is the new normal, does Stafford have the tools to stay in that group, or is the best season of his career already in the rear-view? To date, only one quarterback has passed for 5,000+ yards more than once in his career. With Stafford going so high in mock drafts, it is risky to spend a high pick on someone with so little history to look at.<br/><br/><strong>Michael Vick</strong><br/> I’ll spare you the rehashing of Vick’s fall from grace and redemption. Suffice to say expectations weren’t especially high when he took over the starting spot early in the 2010 season, despite his talent and unique skill set. He proceeded to set the league on fire with a string of staggering performances, peppered with time missed to injury. As the 2011 season opened, expectations had swung wildly the other way, and many believed that a full year back in football plus a rigorous off-season had him back in game shape and ready to improve on his 2010 numbers. His 2011 fantasy season, like the real Eagles’ season, was a huge disappointment. Yet there is reason to be optimistic. The Eagles have now had a year to settle in their crop of flashy free agent pickups from 2011 and if things click with this team they will be very hard to stop. The pieces are all there on paper: athletic and elusive quarterback, elite running back with pass-catching skills, and a strong one-two wideout combination. But like Newton, Vick’s style of play exposes him to more hard hits and dangerous leg tackles than most quarterbacks, and Vick is considerably smaller than Cam Newton. He seems to be trying to develop his mobility in the pocket so he can use his feet without putting himself in harm’s way, but only time will tell. If Vick can stay healthy he’ll be a fantasy stud, with a chance to leap into the top tier of fantasy performers.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Solid Starters</h3>
<p><br/><strong>Phillip Rivers</strong><br/> “Rivers was bad in 2011.” How often have you heard that or some slight variation? The guy threw for 4,624 yards and 27 touchdowns, both down just slightly from his excellent 2010 season (4,710 and 30). The big issue was turnovers; Rivers interception total spiked from 13 in 2010 to 20 last season, and he also lost six fumbles. But frankly that’s a bigger deal for Chargers fans than it is for fantasy. [Note: this year turnovers committed will cost that player -3 points so this may be more relevant going forward.] I think many people expected the Chargers to take a big step forward in an weak division last year and the team’s turnover struggles sank their playoff hopes. Now, sure, some blame can be pinned on Rivers, but so what? The question I care about is whether he can be a quality fantasy starter. Despite his protestations it’s inconceivable that Rivers wasn’t playing injured for at least portions of last year, if not the entire season. On the other hand, with Vincent Jackson in Tampa now, the Chargers’ starting wideouts, presumably Malcolm Floyd and Robert Meachem, look a little shaky. But he still has Antonio Gates who should be coming back healthier than last year. If Rivers showed anything last year it’s that he can still be viable in fantasy while having an off year on a disappointing team. Expect him to return to 2008-2010 form this year if the rest of the offense, and especially the O-line, doesn’t hold him back.<br/><br/><strong>Matt Ryan</strong><br/> The knock on Matty Ice is that while he’s a very good, maybe great, quarterback in the regular season he just can’t get it done in the playoffs. People will point to a Falcons offense that didn’t score in a 24-2 drubbing at the hands of the Giants in the first round of the playoffs. Playoff misfortunes don’t matter in fantasy though. Yes, the Falcons regressed from a lofty 13-3 record in 2010 to 10-6 last season. But three of their six losses were games decided by one score or less, and they were only truly blown out once and that was by the best offense in the NFL. Now factor in a Hall of Fame tight end who seems to defy the aging curve year after year, and the best wide receiver duo in the NFL. [The next post will be about great pairs of receivers on the same team and will expand on this point.] Ryan has been tantalizing over the past two seasons; can he put it all together and deliver the 4,500+ yd/30+ TD season he’s capable of?<br/><br/><strong>Tony Romo</strong><br/> The Cowboys have all the weapons an offense could want but Romo hasn’t yet been able to push his team to the next level. He’s got the big-name receivers, the breakout back, and the Ring of Honor tight end, but the stars refuse to align for Dallas. Miles Austin struggled with hamstring problems last year and he’s already battling a hamstring injury in the preseason. Dez Bryant has almost limitless talent, but his off-the-field demeanor keeps getting in his way. DeMarco Murray was a revelation last year at running back when he took over the starting job from an ailing Felix Jones. Romo has become somewhat notorious for starting slow and picking up speed as the season progresses, especially when November rolls around. If Romo wants to take a step forward he’ll have to be more consistent than he has in the past. But he’ll also have to hope his offensive weapons avoid the injury problems of 2011. <br/> Update: Since I’ve wrote that Witten suffered a lacerated spleen and will miss probably the first 1-3 games and Dez Bryant and Miles Austin are already both battling hamstring problems.<br/><br/><strong>Eli Manning</strong><br/> If anybody can quietly approach 5,000 yards passing it’s Eli Manning. If anybody can quietly become just the third active quarterback with multiple rings, it’s Eli Manning. Somehow Eli is always a little overlooked, even coming off an upset Super Bowl victory over the Patriots (again). The big stories for the Giants last year were the surprise emergence of Victor Cruz and the development of Jason Pierre-Paul. Yet it was Eli who led the team, developing his wideout corps (Cruz, Hakeem Nicks, and Mario Manningham) into a fearsome three-headed threat that stretched the field and made everyone’s jobs easier. Looking at Eli’s numbers is as surprising as it is impressive. He’s also been pretty consistent. Since his first full season as starting quarterback, he’s never thrown for under 3,000 yards or under 20 touchdowns, and never missed a game. He’s also thrown for 4,000+ in each of the past three seasons. On the other hand, he has a not-great 1.43 TD/INT ratio and his highest season passer rating is 93.1 and just 82.1 for his career. But can Eli take his strong 2011 performance and improve on it, or will he have a Super Bowl hangover? The loss of Super Bowl hero Mario Manningham to the 49ers thins the Giants’ depth at wide receiver, and as ESPN’s analysts are fond of saying, there’s no way Victor Cruz is going to repeat that huge number of extremely long plays. I think Eli comes down a little from last year.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Crossroads</h3>
<p><br/><strong>Jay Cutler</strong><br/> Frankly, Jay Cutler can be infuriating. His stupid fucking haircut and look of complete detachment on the sidelines do not endear him to fans, and he never gets the benefit of the doubt when things go wrong. Further, his attitude has somehow made him one of the few players in the NFL whose toughness is openly questioned by analysts, fans, and even current players. Adding to this mess, he’s engaged to tabloid-magnet Kristin Cavallari. The couple just had their first child and, to no one’s surprise, gave him the loathsome name Camden Jack. Seriously. <br/><br/> But back to business. While the debate on Cutler usually focuses on the intangibles, in fantasy we only care about results and quantifiable output. <br/><br/> 2012 will be a pivotal season for the Bears; they will either have to step up and compete with the Lions and Packers or step back and cede the division to Detroit and Green Bay for the foreseeable future. Their defensive playmakers Brian Urlacher and Julius Peppers are aging (34 and 32 respectively) and if they want to put all the pieces together on both sides of the ball they’ll have to do it soon. And that means Cutler has to get his offense in order. <br/><br/> The Bears did themselves no favors this offseason by engaging in a public contract dispute with Matt Forte, although the deal eventually got done. But it remains to be seen if Forte has any lingering bitterness from the ordeal and his attitude could directly impact Cutler as Forte was the Bears’ leading receiver last year. Cutler has also been reunited with former Broncos teammate Brandon Marshall, who will be a key piece if this offense is going to improve. With Marshall to stretch the field defenses will be less able to key on Forte. They also added South Carolina receiver Alshon Jeffery in the draft, who is currently behind Devin Hester on the depth chart but should become a full-time starter this season. One big question mark is the offensive line which, combined with the Bears pass-heavy 2011 offense, allowed Cutler to get sacked non-stop. The Bears have added some weapons, but the NFC North is one of the toughest divisions in football and if the line can’t keep Cutler upright they’re going to have some serious problems. Those problems will be named Jared Allen, Clay Matthews, and Ndamukong Suh, who they’ll see a combined six times. <br/><br/><strong>Ben Roethlisberger</strong><br/> Ben Roethlisberger is a dinosaur in two ways. First, he’s old. Well actually 30 isn’t really that old for quarterbacks these days given how flat the <a href="http://www.advancednflstats.com/2011/08/how-quarterbacks-age.html">aging curve</a> is for their position. But Big Ben takes a lot of punishment, and gets sacked an awful lot. He holds the Steelers franchise record for most times sacked. That’s right: Terry Bradshaw played 14 seasons in Pittsburgh, and by the end of Roethlisberger’s 8th season he’s been sacked more times than Bradshaw. Second, Big Ben’s “backyard football” style (read: scramble around until something good happens) is antithetical to the modern NFL.  Today’s best passing attacks are carefully orchestrated and tightly calibrated to get the most value out of each piece, a style of play to which Roethlisberger it not well-suited. That is unfortunate because the Steelers have one of the strongest WR1 / WR2 duos in the NFL in Mike Wallace and Antonio Brown. On the other hand, both guys are playmakers and Roethlisberger has had success with them despite his improvisational playing style.<br/><br/> The biggest concern, fantasy-wise, about Roethlisberger is that he always seems to get injured at some point. He doesn’t have the gaudy numbers of the quality quarterbacks, and he’s unreliable as a backup because he might be hurt just when you need him. On the other hand, he has a way of making things work out when he is on the field and has certainly had some impressive fantasy performances over the past couple of seasons.<br/><br/><strong>Matt Schaub</strong><br/> Schaub is in a rather awkward position for a starting quarterback in the NFL, playing second fiddle on his own offense. The Texans focus on two things: defense and zone blocking. The zone blocking scheme is the linchpin of their rushing success and it doesn’t look like that will change anytime soon. They should lead the league in both rushing yards and rushing attempts this year (they were tied for first in attempts in 2011 with the Broncos, and were second in yards). They ran in 54% of the time last year, substantially more than the league average 45%, and correspondingly Schaub will get fewer opportunities to throw than perhaps any other starting quarterback in the league. Moreover, their primary receiving threat Andre Johnson has missed 12 games over the past few seasons and it is looking unlikely that he can return to 2008-2009 form. On top of that, there’s no clear WR2 who can ease secondary pressure on Johnson when he is healthy. Finally, Schaub suffered a lisfranc injury in week 10 last year. It can take players as long as a year to return to completely full health after suffering this type of injury. On the other hand, Schaub is clearly a talented quarterback and has posted passer ratings of 92.0 or higher in each of the last four years. <br/><br/><strong>Ryan Fitzpatrick</strong><br/> People are selling low on the Bills this year and I have no fucking clue why. This team would have likely made the playoffs as the sixth seed in the AFC had Fitzpatrick not suffered broken ribs in their week 8 shutout win over the Redskins. Take a look Fitzpatrick’s stats in the first seven games when he played healthy (including the Washington game) compared the last 11. He threw 14 touchdowns against seven picks with a 67.7 completion percentage through the first seven games. The rest of the way he had just 10 touchdowns along with 14 interceptions and a 58.2% completion rate. The week following his injury the Bills began a seven-game losing streak. Fred Jackson’s season-ending injury in week 11 compounded the misery. This is a team that could, and should, improve their record dramatically this season. This isn’t to say that Fitzpatrick is necessarily going to be a fantasy stud. He only had three 300+ yard performances last year and two of those came against the incredibly weak New England defense. But before his injury he was on pace for 32 TD / 16 INT and 3975 yards passing, which would have placed him fifth among quarterbacks in passing touchdowns last year and 11th in yards. On the other hand, the injury might have exacerbated a regression that was already coming. Further, the Bills have some notable holes at receiver and tight end. While Stevie Johnson is very good with flashes of great and Fred Jackson is a capable pass-catcher, the lack of other playmakers is troubling from a fantasy perspective. However if I had a quarterback from this tier on my roster I would probably want it to be Fitzpatrick.<br/><br/><strong>Andy Dalton</strong><br/> The “Red Rocket” was a pleasant surprise for the Bengals last year, leading them to a playoff berth in his rookie season. If I recall correctly someone used him as a fill-in starter for an injured player last season. But looking at his numbers I was surprised to see how pedestrian they were. He threw 20 touchdowns against 13 interceptions with 3,398 yards passing and a 58.1% completion rate. Certainly, that is impressive for a rookie as it usually takes a year or more to acclimate to the NFL game. Dalton had great chemistry with fellow rookie AJ Green who has the size, hands, and skill to be an elite receiver. Unfortunately Cincy really has no other threats at that position so Green will have DBs draped all over him. I don’t think Dalton’s ceiling is particularly high, and he shouldn’t really be considered a starter. <br/><br/><strong>Josh Freeman</strong><br/> Freeman had a breakout year in 2010 in his first full year as a starter. His yardage total was unimpressive, but he he had a pristine 25/6 touchdown to interception ratio. He was due to regress some anyway, but nobody really expected the bottom to completely drop out. While his yardage ticked up a little in 2011, he posted just 16 touchdowns with 22 picks. Freeman is due for a swing back the other way, and the additions of Vincent Jackson at wideout and first-round draft pick Doug Martin at running back can only help. Still the Bucs have some serious problems and this looks to be a tough year for them, especially within their own division: the Saints will be good as usual, the Falcons should handle business, and the Panthers with Cam Newton are no longer a doormat. <br/><br/><strong>Peyton Manning</strong><br/> The guy is a question mark. Nobody knows how effective he’ll be, if his arm strength is back, and if he can take a hard hit. In fantasy the issue is value. Currently on fantasyfootballcalculator.com Peyton’s average draft position is around the beginning of the sixth round and is going as the eighth quarterback, just ahead of Romo, Rivers, and Eli. To me this feels too high. I think a big payoff is pretty unlikely, and I’d rather have the consistency of the third tier guys if they’re available. Make no mistake, you absolutely must have a workable backup if you draft Peyton. <br/><br/> I’m down on Peyton for a few reasons aside from his health. First, as Peyton himself noted in recent remarks to the press, this only the fourth time he’s had to learn a new offense in his entire football career. He learned one in high school, one in college, and one when he started with the Colts 14 years ago. Now he’s learning the Broncos’ offense, and as great a quarterback as he is, there are bound to be bumps in the road. Second, the offensive weapons he has at his disposal are a step down from what he worked with in Indy. Aside from his receivers’ skill, he also had chemistry and experience with his former teammates. He’ll have to start from scratch in Denver. Finally, the Denver offense is pivoting 180 degrees from last year. In 2011 they ran it more often than any other team in the NFL and now they will be implementing a completely new offense to take advantage of Peyton’s skills and the transition may not be smooth. Tread carefully.<br/><br/><strong>Joe Flacco</strong><br/> Blah. Joe Flacco will not be on my fantasy team this year. I said at the beginning “The last group are players at some sort of crossroads, and it’s not clear if they’re on the way up, on the way down, or just settling into serviceable mediocrity.” With Flacco it actually is clear. He’s blah.</p>
