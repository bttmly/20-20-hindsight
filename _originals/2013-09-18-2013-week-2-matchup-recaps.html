<p class="lede">Amid a rash of injuries, four teams advance to 2-0, four teams fall to 0-2, and six sit at 1-1</p><!-- more -->
<p>A number of fantasy notables went down with injuries this week, with effects likely stretching beyond this slate of matchups. Injured players included Ray Rice, Steven Jackson, Eddie Lacy, Maurice Jones-Drew, Reggie Bush, Andre Johnson, and Larry Fitzgerald. </p>

<h6 class="matchup-teams">Steamin&#8217; Jimmy Beamen v. The Super Snakes</h6>
<p>I was surprised how close this one ended up. It started off great for me, with Tom Brady (13FP) and Kellen Winslow (1FP) posting disappointing numbers in the Thursday game. For me, Andrew Luck was decent against the Dolphins, LeSean McCoy was productive thanks to a shocking 114 receiving yards, and Dwayne Bowe found the end zone for the first time. My biggest stud so far has been Jordy Nelson, who has three end zone trips already this season. There were some glaring problems too though: Steven Jackson exited early with a thigh injury, and Randy Bullock is a terrible kicker. I mean seriously though, look <a href="http://prod.static.texans.clubs.nfl.com//assets/images/imported/HOU/Bullock_Randy.jpg">at this guy</a>. Despite some strong games for my guys, Max was actually up in this game going into Monday Night Football.</p>
<p>If you have a top-5 QB you&#8217;re going to sink or swim right along with him. Brady&#8217;s dearth of viable weapons showed clearly last Thursday in the Pat&#8217;s ugly 13-10 win over Geno &amp; The Jets (sounds like a crappy lounge band, right?). Still, Max was somehow able to muster 88 points thanks to 17 from Mike Wallace and Denver kicker Matt Prater&#8217;s 13. He had a tenuous eight-point lead heading into Monday, with Tyler Eifert and the Law Firm still to go for me. I just noticed that Eifert&#8217;s initials are &#8220;TE&#8221;&#8230; <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative_determinism">nomen est omen</a></em> eh?</p>
<p>Anyway, Pittsburgh – Cincinnati on MNF sealed it for me with 13 combined from Eifert and Green-Ellis to push me ahead. Just FYI, the absolute least exciting way to win a fantasy matchup is BenJarvus Green-Ellis grinding clock and plodding for 75 yards on 22 carries.</p>

<h3 id="matchup2" class="matchup-names">Pat v. Ali</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Hacksaw! Ball So Hard University v. Bartender! New Team Please</h6>
<p>After rolling up 120 points in Week 1, Ali&#8217;s squad absolutely cratered this week. Collin Kaepernick (1FP) led the suck parade but he was joined by basically everyone else on Ali&#8217;s roster. Apart from CJ Spiller (12FP), none of Ali&#8217;s starters reached double digits, and five of those nine didn&#8217;t exceed 5FP. Look, if Sam Bradford on your bench outscores Kaep by 30, it&#8217;s over.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what to make of Pat&#8217;s team yet. He had decent to strong performances pretty much across the board but still didn&#8217;t break 100. Matt Ryan is as consistent as the rising sun, but with Roddy White ailing he doesn&#8217;t have the monster upside of Rodgers and Brees. Arian Foster is more reliant on touchdowns than ever, as he struggles to churn out yards despite getting plenty of work. On the other hand, the receiving corps of Victor Cruz, Tavon Austin, and Steve Smith will be downright deadly in some weeks. And Frank Gore won&#8217;t be facing off against the goddamn Seahawks every week. Long story short, I can&#8217;t tell if Pat is rising or falling but we should find out soon.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>Ali<span>(1-1)</span></span><span>52</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Pat<span>(1-1)</span></span><span>95</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup3" class="matchup-names">AJ v. Justin</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Deez Nutz Regin on Your Parade v. The Chesapeake Ripper</h6>
<p>For the second straight week Michael Vick logged three total touchdowns, but this time around he piled up an incredible 428 passing yards to go along with them, and totaled 37FP. Vick&#8217;s monster game, along with 21 from the Patriots D/ST and 18 from Randall Cobb would have been enough to put away Justin. But aside from those three AJ had no other double-digit contributors, and Ray Rice&#8217;s hip injury could really screw things up going forward. Unfortunately for AJ his Week 3 opponent, Max, owns Rice&#8217;s presumptive replacement, Bernard Pierce. Still, AJ has more bench depth than most including Bilal Powell (12FP) and Martellus Bennet (19FP) who both had nice outings in Week 2.</p>
<p>As for Justin, his roster problems go very deep. Doug Martin, whom he drafted second overall, has carried the rock an astounding 53 times over the first two weeks but has just 23 fantasy points to show for it and is averaging less than 4 yards per tote. Cam Newton is 19th in fantasy points among quarterbacks, behind rookie EJ Manuel. like. While his rocky Week 1 outing was explainable – the Panthers were hosting the Seahawks – last Sunday&#8217;s performance against the Bills was a head-scratcher. The lack of rushing yards for Cam is also disappointing. Last point about this roster: his six skill position slots netted him 29 points combined this week. Take out Martin&#8217;s 14 and the rest averaged just 3FP apiece. Yuck.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>Justin<span>(0-2)</span></span><span>73</span></span><span class="winner"><span>AJ<span>(2-0)</span></span><span>106</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup4" class="matchup-names">Dave v. Paul</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">The Sultan of Squats v. Only Winners Get Wings</h6>
<figure><img src="http://cdn.uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/rains-cat.gif"/><figcaption class="text-center text-big">Realizing you&#8217;re up against Aaron Rodgers coming off a tough loss and playing in his home opener. #GameOfThrows because quarterbacks, amirite?</figcaption></figure><p>In <a href="http://">Dave&#8217;s draft report card</a> I looked at some questions about how many touches some of his guys would get. For this week, at least, those questions were largely moot. Dave jumped out to a big early lead thanks to Aaron Rodgers&#8217; (43FP) clinical vivisection of the Redskins. There are few things in fantasy football less appealing than facing off against Rodgers when the Packers are returning to the comfortable confines of Lambeau Field after a tough loss on the road. Dave also benefitted from some notable injuries. With Roddy White a non-factor, Julio Jones had a career day with 11 receptions for 182 yards and a touchdown. Ahmad Bradshaw logged 13FP in the absence of Vick Ballard. The Denver D/ST contributed 18 thanks to a passel of takeaways and a defensive touchdown. But it wasn&#8217;t quite all sunshine and rainbows for Dave. Mike Williams had a goose egg and the Bucs are on the verge of complete collapse anyway. DeMarco Murray ground out just 25 yards on his 12 carries, though he was able to snag five of the six passes thrown his direction for 49 yards. Finally, Vincent Brown had just 2FP. On the other hand, two rookies on his bench were sensational with both DeAndre Hopkins and Gio Bernard putting up 17.</p>
<p>This was an underwhelming week almost across the board for Paul. After 38FP combined last week the Romo-Witten combo netted only 15. Trent Richardson and Andre Johnson had just seven fantasy points each. Aside from Romo, the only guys to reach double digits were Jermichael Finley and Megatron, the latter of whom was the lone bright spot for Paul. After a miserable three point outing in Week 1, Calvin Johnson bounced back in a huge way despite battling with Patrick Person all day. He hauled in six balls for 116 yards and a pair of scores, and also had an impromptu <a href="https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/563049_10151839578558605_1270126652_n.jpg">jersey exchange</a> with Peterson after the game.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>Paul<span>(0-2)</span></span><span>81</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Dave<span>(2-0)</span></span><span>115</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup5" class="matchup-names">Zak v. ZM</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Brees: Fantasy Jesus v. Orange County Gunners</h6>
<p>Zak should certainly count himself lucky here. I&#8217;d wager this will be the only game this season he wins where Brees scores less than 15. Monster outings by DeSean Jackson (25FP) and Jimmy Graham (23FP) helped immensely. Other parts of this roster are sagging though. Julian Edelman somehow gained 78 yards on an incredible 13 catches. Stevan Ridley is getting carries but not yards. Antonio Brown is sorely missing the Mike Wallace Distraction Factor. Still, he escaped with a win and has guys on his bench like Knowshon Moreno and Chris Givens, who could slot in as contributors.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger is not a viable starting QB under our league&#8217;s scoring, and a depleted receiving corps and collapsing offensive line aren&#8217;t helping. Swap him out for, say, Flacco or Alex Smith and this could be a playoff roster. He has two dominant receivers in Thomas and Bryant, one good RB and another with some upside, and supplemental guys to fill in during byes. But as long as Roethlisberger is at the top of the roster this team is a non-starter. </p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>ZM<span>(0-2)</span></span><span>91</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Zak<span>(1-1)</span></span><span>103</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup6" class="matchup-names">Brian v. Phil</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Shawp City Cake Beaters v. Hurry Up Wit My Damn Croissants</h6>
<p>Not a whole lot to say about this one. Almost everything went right for Brian, and pretty much everything went wrong for Phil. For Brian, despite all the wailing and gnashing of teeth about RG3, he&#8217;s been fine in fantasy. Over on Grantland, Bill Barnwell often separates out stats for when games are competitive from when games are in blowout situations, with a 14-point differential being the divider. Obviously this isn&#8217;t perfect; teams have overcome much bigger deficits than that. A two touchdown lead in the second quarter is dramatically different than the same score in the fourth. That said, RG3&#8217;s nickname this season should be Garbage Man. He could even have a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr5H93NDSRg">theme song</a>. By my count, Griffin logged just 2FP when the Skins were within two scores of the Pack. The rest of his 27FP came once the Packers went up 17-0 early in the second quarter. Still, the RG3-Pierre Garçon connection is nothing to scoff at, with the pair connecting six times for 143 yards and a touchdown. Marshawn Lynch scored all three of the Seahawk&#8217;s touchdowns, Stevie Johnson had 100+ yards and a score, Matt Forte rang up 161 total yards, and Lamar Miller got back on track after a Week 1 goose egg.</p>
<p>As for Phil, what a fuckin&#8217; train wreck.</p>
<figure><img src="http://s23.postimg.org/n5nbo29nf/unhappiness.jpg"/><figcaption class="text-center text-big">He didn&#8217;t take it well.</figcaption></figure><p>Russell Wilson managed just 11FP in a game the &#8216;Hawks dominated. The Bears defense gave up 30 points to the fucking Vikings, but somehow salvaged their day with some takeaways and a touchdown. MJD got hurt. Jared Cook turned back into a pumpkin. David Akers is a <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/sports/cardinals/articles/20130915kicker-david-akers-still-cant-fix-woes-vs-arizona-cardinals.html">disaster</a>. T.Y. Hilton was solid though I guess.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>Phil<span>(0-2)</span></span><span>56</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Brian<span>(1-1)</span></span><span>147</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup7" class="matchup-names">Jenny v. Hoop</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Niner Faithful v. I&#8217;m Not a Star</h6>
<p>This is what happens when AP fumbles once instead of scoring twice. Hoop&#8217;s team is good, but top-heavy; his success will rest largely on the production of Stafford, Peterson, and Marshall. Obviously every team has guys they rely on more than others but my read on Hoop&#8217;s team is that this is especially the case here. Ryan Mathews and Torrey Smith are hugely unreliable, and Daniel Thomas really should&#8217;t be in a starting lineup. He&#8217;ll has some options on the way with Josh Gordon available this week and Danny Amendola returning eventually. I see a big bounce back week for Hoop coming up, but dropping a winnable matchup against inferior competition must have been maddening.</p>
<p>Despite the 2-0 record I maintain my poor rating of Jenny&#8217;s draft. Her top scorer was the Seahawks defense. Obviously that unit is very, very good. But for Jenny to continue winning they&#8217;ll have to repeat their Sunday Night gem against the Niners week in and week out. Yes, Peyton is crushing it. Great. After the QB and the defense though? Things get ugly quick. Rashard Mendenhall and Greg Olsen each notched 14FP this week. Bravo. We&#8217;ll see if either matches that total the rest of the way. Yeah, AJ Green and Anquan Boldin (4FP and 0FP respectively) won&#8217;t submit numbers numbers like those again any time soon. But Eddie Lacy will almost certainly miss this week&#8217;s game and will expose Jenny&#8217;s non-existent RB detph; aside from Lacy and Mendenhall the only other back on her roster is Marcel Reece. On the other hand, I just looked at the Denver schedule and I don&#8217;t really see a single legit defense on there. It&#8217;s possible Peyton breaks every single quarterback record this season and carries Jenny to a championship.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>Hoop<span>(1-1)</span></span><span>86</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Jenny<span>(2-0)</span></span><span>96</span></span></p>
