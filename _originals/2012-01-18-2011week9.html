<p><em><span>Originally posted 11/8/11</span></em><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>DEM 116 (4-4-1); MS 66 (4-5)</span></strong><br/><span>Matt  Ryan and Julio Jones were finally on the same page on Sunday, hooking  up for two long touchdowns and totaling 55 between them. This was Jones&#8217;  first game back from a hamstring injury which cost him two games, and  it&#8217;s hard to ask for a better team to return against than the Colts. The  Packers defense also had a fantasy day. Despite allowing 38 points to  the Chargers, they picked off Philip Rivers twice, two of which were  returned for touchdowns. Antonio Brown benefitted from the defensive  attention Mike Wallace has been drawing; he caught 5 balls for 109  yards. My bench-warmers Marshawn Lynch (19) and Andy Dalton (26) also  were productive. AJ had a rough week with the highly productive Cam  Newton/Greg Olsen combo on bye. He had to start Ryan Fitzpatrick who was  picked off twice by the Jets and managed only 11 fantasy points. One  bright spot was Pierre Thomas who picked up 66 yards and a TD on just 8  carries, and also caught 4 passes. Another one was Brandon Marshall with  his biggest day of the season so far in the Dolphins&#8217; surprise blowout  of the Chiefs.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>TWS 88 (9-0); JUIC 86 (4-5)</span></strong><br/><span>Max  narrowly avoided a disaster this week, squeaking out a win over ZM by  just two points. Eli Manning was solid again, throwing for 250 yards, 2  TD and a pick, and Arian Foster had his third 20+ game of the season.  However Matt Forte, who had been averaging over 17 points a game,  fumbled twice and only ended with 10. Furthermore, none of his receivers  found the endzone and the Chiefs defense netted -1. ZM was almost able  to ride LeSean McCoy to victory but came up just short. McCoy only got  16 carries this week after getting 28 and 30 the past two games. Another  big performer for ZM was Cardinals D/ST which racked up 17 against St.  Louis with a pick, a blocked punt, four sacks and a punt returned for a  score. Adding to the tension was kicker John Kasay&#8217;s missed a field  goal; if it had been on target Max would have suffered his first  loss.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>MARC 104 (3-6); LINC 103(3-6)</span></strong><br/><span>Here&#8217;s  what Jenny was thinking this weekend: &#8220;Reggie Bush with 20!?&#8221; Yep. 20.  Easily the biggest surprise of Sunday came from Reggie Bush and his  fellow Miami Dolphins. They demolished the Chiefs, fresh off of four  straight wins, for their first victory of the season. I&#8217;m not going to  do any research but I&#8217;ll go ahead and assume this was Bush&#8217;s best  fantasy day of his career: 13 attempts for 92 yards and a score, and 3  catches for 50 yards. Jordan also capitalized on Philip Rivers best  (fantasy) performance of the year â€“ 385 yards, 4 TD in a shootout  against the Packers. A QB scoring 33 fantasy points despite throwing two  &lt;a  href=&#8221;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=taint&amp;page=14&#8221;&gt;TAINTs&lt;/a&gt;  seems a little unfair but I guess that&#8217;s the way it goes. Jenny&#8217;s top  performer was Willis McGahee who racked up 28 in the Broncos upset over  Oakland. Schaub had a quiet day and threw for just 119 yards and 0 TD.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>SPAU 91 (4-4-1); HUH? 89 (4-5)</span></strong><br/><span>After  winning three straight, Ali dropped a heartbreaker this week to his  brother-in-law, coming up just two points short. Most disappointing was  Fred Jackson&#8217;s fumble, which cost Ali the margin of victory, plus  whatever Jackson would have gained on that play. It was Jackson&#8217;s first  single-digit game of the year. Another issue was the lack of production  from Braylong Edwards and Deion Branch. In fact, all of his receivers  did worse than Jabar Gaffney who sat on the bench this week. Andre was  able to salvage a win despite Colt McCoy&#8217;s dismal 9-point outing.  Brandon Jacobs logged 15 points, benefitting immensely from Ahmad  Bradshaw&#8217;s absence. Mike Wallace and Josh Cribbs each reached double  digits, and kicker David Akers had 16 of his own.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>TUSK 124 (6-3); BREH 84 (5-4</span></strong><br/><span>Pat  dropped his third straight matchup this week in a 40-point loss to  Phil. Dez Bryant failed to reach double digits for the second straight  week despite Miles Austin&#8217;s early exit with a hamstring injury. But  Vick&#8217;s 9-pointer hurt worse. He did get big performances out of Ben  Tate, Wes Welker and Jordy Nelson, but it wasn&#8217;t even close to enough.  Rob Gronkowski sat on the bench with 16. Phil had big games across the  board, led by Vincent Jackson&#8217;s 3 TD 32-point effort. Brees had 22, Ray  Rice had 14 and even LaDainian Tomlinson found the endzone. The Niners  D/ST also did well, notching three takeaways against the sputtering  Redskins.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>ZAK 78 (1-8), WILL 87 (6-3)</span></strong><br/><span>Zak&#8217;s  team has been struggling lately, especially with Brady failing to match  his early season numbers. He had 42, 34 and 31 in the first three  weeks, but has hit 20 only once since then. The lone standout for Zak  was Michael Bush, who took 19 touches with McFadden sidelined. He had 98  yards rushing and two catches for 33 yards and a score. The rest of  Zak&#8217;s lineup fared poorly: the only other player in double digits was  the Texans D/ST. He also had four players on bye weeks. Dave, as usual,  pinned his hopes to Aaron Rodgers and was not disappointed. Rodgers  hasn&#8217;t had a game below 25 points so far this year, and has thrown for  multiple touchdowns in each outing. He has 24 TDs against just 3 INTs.  Mike Tolbert also put up big numbers, tearing up 142 yards from  scrimmage and rushing for a TD. Unfortunately, DHB and DeSean Jackson  both ended with goose-eggs, and the Raiders D/ST had a miserable -3.  Despite Rodgers&#8217; 38, Dave was lucky to grab a win this week.</span></p>
