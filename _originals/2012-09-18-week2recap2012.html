<!-- more -->
<div class="perma-only">
<p>This past Sunday was a wild one as many of the storylines from week one were upended. Joe Flacco&#8217;s new uptempo, pass-first offense? Well, he completed just 52.4% of his passes and couldn&#8217;t put the Eagles away despite his defense coming up with four takeaways. The Jets had a 48-point outing last week. This time around they mustered just 10 points, which was the exact same number of completions Sanchez recorded. After blasting a decent Titans team last week everyone expected the Pats to decimate the Cardinals in their home opener at Foxboro. Instead the Arizona defense was able to largely contain Brady&#8217;s squad, and came away with the win despite seemingly fumbling the game away late in the fourth after Pats kicker Stephen Gostkowski botched a 42-yard attempt with time expiring. News flash: in games against other divisions the NFC West is 5-1 right now, with victories against the Patriots, Packers, Lions, Cowboys, and resurgent Redskins. Do you want another early indication of how topsy-turvy this season has been so far? Matt Ryan is currently leading the league in passer rating, which isn&#8217;t that shocking. But right behind him is Alex Smith, followed by Sam Bradford, RGIII, and Philip Rivers. Where art thou Rodgers?</p>
<p>Within the league we had three civil war contests with roommates /cohabitants matched up against each other: Bri and Hoop, me and Max, and Zak and Jenny. Going into Monday night two of those three were undecided, along with Pat and Ali&#8217;s matchup. The strangeness of that game impacted all three in different ways. Peyton&#8217;s three early interceptions boosted Brian, killed Ali, and kept my matchup tense until the fourth quarter. Let&#8217;s get it.</p>

<h3>Dave v. Phil</h3>
<p><em>That&#8217;s No Moon v. The Bauce of Sauce</em></p>
<p>A one point loss is hard to swallow - I know <a href="http://20-20hindsight.tumblr.com/2012/01/18/2011week12.html">from experience</a>. But it should be a little easier when you score the fewest points of all teams in the league; Phil would have been flat-out torched if he had faced anyone besides Dave. This matchup featured two quarterbacks taken in the first round in Tom Brady and Matt Stafford, who finished with just 15 and 13 fantasy points respectively. Each was outscored by the rookie backup on the bench, who just happened to be Luck and RGIII, the top two picks in this year&#8217;s real-life NFL draft. The tight ends were a fantasy nightmare: Gates (for Dave) was scratched right before kickoff and Hernandez (for Phil) exited early with a high ankle sprain that will keep him out for weeks. With Greg Jennings sidelined with injury, Phil was forced to pick up and start Nate Burleson who was held to just 11 yards by the stout Niners defense. Stevie Johnson had an OK day (11 points) but it doesn&#8217;t bode well that he barely reached double-digits in a big offensive outing for the Bills. Also disappointing was Steven Jackson, who was left the game early due to either injury or an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty depending on which report you believe. I&#8217;m shocked Dave was able to overcome three zeroes, including from Gates and Larry Fitzgerald, the latter of whom had one of his worst outings ever (one catch, four yards). Things aren&#8217;t terribly bleak for Dave; he won the matchup and had 25 from Trent Richardson on the bench. Also RGIII was excellent with 31, but now Dave will have to decide whether to keep the rookie signal caller and play the matchup game, or double down on Stafford despite his slow start and make a trade. Things are far more dire for Phil and they&#8217;ll go from bad to worse if Jennings can&#8217;t make it back soon. He&#8217;ll need to clear the dead weight from his bench, specifically a spare kicker and Brandon Jacobs who hasn&#8217;t practiced in weeks. There&#8217;s nowhere near as many free agent targets this week as there were last week, but Phil will need to stay up tonight and snag someone if he wants to turn things around. He&#8217;s in really bad shape at tight end with Hernandez likely to sit for an extended period and backup Dustin Keller currently working on a hamstring injury.</p>
<p><strong>Dave 60 (1-1); Phil 59 (1-1)</strong></p>
<h3>ZM v. AJ</h3>
<p><em>Orange County Gunners v. No Work Today</em></p>
<p>Losing Fred Jackson really crushed AJ&#8217;s team, which I graded among the strongest out of the gate. Also, relying on Matt Schaub isn&#8217;t looking like a good idea. In the Texans&#8217; dominant win at Jacksonville this week Schaub only had seven fantasy points. AJ&#8217;s squad was buoyed a bit by decent outings from Percy Harvin and Malcolm Floyd, and late-round pick Danny Amendola had a career day with a ludicrous 15 receptions for 160 yards and a touchdown for 19 points, including -3 docked for losing a fumble early. But it&#8217;s basically impossible to win when your quarterback turns in single digits. AJ was incensed to learn that the Bills D/ST, which he jettisoned last week after they had gave up 48 points to the Jets, scored 26 against the Chiefs with three takeaways and a touchdown. ZM got a nice day out of V. Jax, and had decent contributions from DeAngelo Williams and LeSean McCoy, although McCoy has not looked like a top-three running back through the first two games. A big day for Cam Newton was all that ZM needed to put this one away and the sophomore QB delivered with 26 FP in the Panthers&#8217; victory over the foundering Saints in which Cam notched his first rushing touchdown of the season.</p>
<p><strong>ZM 91 (1-1); AJ 73 (0-2)</strong></p>
<h3>Pat v. Ali</h3>
<p><em>Town Taxes v. Chomo Se Dice: Bolsa de Bolsas</em></p>
<p>These guys were neck-and-neck going into Monday night. Vernon Davis&#8217;s two touchdown grabs and Victor Cruz&#8217;s 179 yards plus a score were the lynchpins for Ali, along with 12-point contributions from both MJD and Darren Sproles. On the other hand, Robert Meachem (0) and Jamaal Charles (1) shit the bed. Pat got two garbage time touchdowns from Dwayne Bowe and a very nice 18 FP outing from Marshawn Lynch. After a strong game in the season opener Pat decided to stick with Tony Romo who had a rough day (13 FP) in the Cowboys&#8217; 27-7 loss to the Seahawks, and was outscored in fantasy by all three of Pat&#8217;s other QBs (Palmer 17, Vick 20, Dalton 27). Given his draft spot, Calvin Johnson was also underwhelming with 94 yards receiving and no scores (9 FP). Going into MNF Pat was up one point, 78-77, with Roddy White and Tony Gonzalez to play, while Ali had Peyton and Denver kicker Matt Prater still to go. It didn&#8217;t take long for Peyton to close the door on Ali&#8217;s chances in this matchup. With three first quarter interceptions Peyton bottomed out at -8 fantasy points before bouncing back to six by the end of the game. Those picks also hurt Matt Prater with the Broncos playing aggressively to score touchdowns as they tried to catch up in the second half. On Pat&#8217;s side both White and Gonzalez had great games: 10 catches for 102 yards, and 7 catches for 70 yards, respectively. Plus each found the end zone once. Despite some nice play in the second half, Peyton&#8217;s goose was cooked in the first half and this one got away from Ali just a couple minutes into MNF.</p>
<p><strong>Pat 107 (1-1); Ali 86 (0-2)</strong></p>
<h3>Hooper v. Brian</h3>
<p><em>Woodgrain Chestnut v. We Got Nicks Like Jesus</em></p>
<p>Well this one was surprising. Back on my draft grades you&#8217;ll find Hoop right at the top and Brian way down at the bottom. I&#8217;ll admit I didn&#8217;t see this one coming. To me at least, Hoop looked like a lock this week, but Aaron Rodgers&#8217;s lackluster 11 FP outing on Thursday night made this one interesting. Still with monsters like Adrian Peterson and Jimmy Graham, guys primed for a breakout like Brandon LaFell and Doug Martin, and the stout Texans D/ST against the struggling Jaguars, I was sure Brian was in trouble. But C.J. Spiller (15 carries, 123 rush yards, 2 TD) and Hakeem Nicks (10 catches, 199 receiving yards, 1 TD) each had career days and combined for 53 FP. Let me just say that right now C.J. Spiller is running like a man possessed. On the season he has 29 carries for 292 yards with three rushing touchdowns, and five grabs for 62 yards, totaling 354 yards from scrimmage on just 34 offensive touches. Clearly, he won&#8217;t be able to continue to gash defenses as effectively he has the past two weeks, but these past two performances have been truly staggering and even if he comes back to earth a little he&#8217;ll still be a stud. His performance so far has been a little like Jamaal Charles&#8217;s 2010 season when he set the gold standard for rushing efficiency with 230 carries for 1467 yards (6.4 YPC). Spiller seems best suited for a similar workload, in the ballpark of 13-17 carries per game. Brian&#8217;s boom-bust roster is dangerous in any week but I think he&#8217;ll struggle with consistency. Hoop&#8217;s team is the opposite, with seven of his nine starters notching double digits. But Rodgers&#8217;s inability to put up his typical 25 points was a killer, and after a big outing last week AP&#8217;s output sagged a little. He accumulated just 60 yards on 16 carries (3.75 YPC) and failed to find the end zone. This matchup was still very much on the line going into Monday night, with Brian up a few points but projected to lose. Starting a defense on Monday when you are ahead in your matchup is nerve-wracking; defenses are by far the most likely to turn in negative points and there&#8217;s nothing worse than watching an inept defense give away a win. <em>(Note: it&#8217;s totally acceptable to bench a player going into Monday if you think it will improve your chances of winning)</em> But the Atlanta defense stepped up big and picked off Peyton three times in the first quarter due to a combination of poor decisions and disguised coverage. They came up with a fumble later in the half and emphatically put this one in the win column for Brian.</p>
<p><strong>Brian 110 (1-1); Hooper 98 (1-1)</strong></p>
<h3>Nick v. Max</h3>
<p><em>Charlie&#8217;s $150 Dick Rash v. Fuck You Aaron Sorkin</em></p>
<p>Reggie Bush. Good lord. This season the guy is on a mission to prove he can be a feature back in the NFL and so far, so good. Towards the end of last season he came on strong, with four straight 100+ rushing yard games to end the season including a 203 yard outing against the Bills in Week 15. He was a little underwhelming last week as the Dolphins were playing catch-up and fed him just 14 carries, but he still posted a nice 4.9 YPC. Against the Raiders on Sunday he went absolutely wild, piling up 172 yards and two rushing scores on 26 carries for an league-best 31 FP. In another early game Philip Rivers was torching the Titans to the tune of 284 yards and three touchdowns along with one interception, good for 26 FP. After a poor showing last year Rivers certainly seems to have regained his form despite Antonio Gates&#8217;s persistent injuries and the loss of Vincent Jackson to the Bucs. Bush and Rivers put me in a deep hole early and it took a while to climb out. Arian Foster helped with 20 FP against the Jags, but teammate Ben Tate (who was on my bench) had 21 behind two poached touchdowns which was brutal. Reggie Wayne continued to show he&#8217;s got more left in the tank than many expected; he grabbed six balls for 71 yards and a score. At this early point in the season he&#8217;s looking like one of the bigger draft day steals, having emerged as Andrew Luck&#8217;s favorite target with 15 catches for 206 yards and a touchdown through two games. But the rest of my squad was thoroughly unimpressive: Jason Witten and Torrey Smith had just five FP each and the circumstances for each were distressing. After a fireworks show in the opener the Baltimore offense looked listless in their narrow loss to Philly as Smith saw just a handful of targets. Witten was just horrible, with Bill Barnwell from Grantland charging him with four drops on the day. Yuck. Ultimately Max was up 90-55 going into the MNF showdown between the Falcons and Broncos, with Matt Ryan, Julio Jones, and Willis McGahee still to go for me and the Denver D/ST for him. The big stories today are Peyton&#8217;s picks and the refs&#8217; ineptitude, not necessarily in that order. One thing I&#8217;m not seeing is any criticism leveled at the Atlanta offense. Yeah, they put up 27 points and won the game. But when you have a +4 turnover ratio you should win games, and more decisively than 27-21. The Falcons cashed in on an early interception return to the Denver 1-yd line but only generated a single field goal from the next two Manning interceptions and ended the half with two three-and-outs and a kneel down (basically) in their last three possessions. The Falcons have jumped to third in ESPN&#8217;s power rankings, but I&#8217;m not sure this win is as encouraging as everyone seems to think. Anyway, Julio Jones displayed some of the boom/bust you&#8217;ll get with any receiver, but the depth of his routes was discouraging; he grabbed four of seven targets for just 14 yards. Matty Ice was good-not-great with 21 FP but Willis McGahee and his two short touchdown runs really put me over the top here. With guys on both sides of the ball and the matchup on the line, this was one of my favorite MNF watching experiences ever.</p>
<p><strong>Nick 101 (2-0); Max 90 (1-1)</strong></p>
<h3>Jenny v. Zak</h3>
<p><em>First Place With a D On My Bench v. T&#8217;Supp Gurl</em></p>
<p>After a slow start Jenny&#8217;s squad had an incredible turn around to again notch the best league point total of the week. Her star performer was Eli Manning, whose Giants offense looked awful for three quarters against Tampa Bay before lighting up the scoreboard with 25 points in the fourth. Eli finished with 510 yards, three touchdowns and three picks (29 FP). She also got decent contributions from the Ravens D/ST which recorded four takeaways (in a loss!) and Packers kicker Mason Crosby with 14. Luckily this one wasn&#8217;t close or Jenny might have been kicking herself for sitting the ballhawking Packers D/ST which held Cutler to zero net FP and the Bears offense to just 10 points while snagging four picks. Green Bay tied with the 49ers for most takeaways last year (38). Ray Rice was solid, but his carry-per-game total has taken a little slide. I assume the Ravens will fix this as they try to find answers after failing to sieze the day in Philly. Shonn Greene was back to his usual self - ineffective, then hurt. Marques Colston had just four FP and the entire Saints team seems to be in the early stages of a full-on tailspin. Speaking of which&#8230; Zak may have hitched his horse to the wrong plow in Drew Brees. While he still put up a respectable 19, that&#8217;s far below his 25+ average from last season. That difference wouldn&#8217;t have turned this matchup, but Brees doesn&#8217;t look like the same no-limit upside player from last year when he set the league record for passing yards while leading the Saints to victories against a fistful of playoff teams teams including Houston (40-33), Atlanta (26-23 OT, then 45-16), Detroit (31-17) and the New York Giants (49-24). Even beyond the struggles of Drew Brees, Zak&#8217;s team could fall off a cliff in the upcoming weeks. The Pittsburgh backfield split between Dwyer and Redman seems even-ish right now (each had 12 carries Sunday against the Jets), but as shown by Redman&#8217;s 2-yd touchdown run on Sunday, he&#8217;s the one preferred near the goal line so Dwyer may continue to be a roster black hole for Zak. Jared Cook, whom many forecasted as a potential breakout fantasy stud (does a matchup nightmare tight end at 6&#8217;5, 250 lbs. sound familiar?) is struggling along with the rest of the surprisingly impotent Titans attack. More worrisome is Wes Welker&#8217;s reduced workload which has led to speculation that he will soon be supplanted by Julian Edelman and possibly traded away, presumably due to the failure to settle on a contract with the team. However, with Hernandez suffering a high ankle sprain on Sunday the Patriots may be unable to cast him aside just yet. <em>(Note: Edelman wouldn&#8217;t be taking Welker&#8217;s </em>role<em> in the offense, but rather his position in the slot. In the offseason the Patriots were reportedly reorienting their offense with Hernandez at the focal point and lined up all over the field, in contrast to the Welker-centric offense of 2011. Many saw the big contract Hernandez got and the team&#8217;s inability to work out a deal with Welker as a strong indication of the Patriots&#8217; intentions.)</em> However, if Welker&#8217;s production slides further Zak might be forced into the unenviable position of relying on boom/bust receivers like DeSean Jackson and Lance Moore. Should I keep going with the problems here? Turner was never explosive, but now he just looks plodding (42 yards on 17 carries vs. the Broncos, 2.5 YPC) and won&#8217;t put up significant fantasy points unless he finds the end zone. Kevin Smith has been so-so for the Lions over the past two weeks and they&#8217;re probably eager to work in Mikel Leshore (returning from suspension this week) to see if he can make anything happen. Laurent Robinson has Blaine Gabbert at QB. Unless he strikes gold with one of these lottery ticket receivers (I&#8217;m looking at you, Randall Cobb and Kevin Ogletree) Zak could be in for a long, rough season.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny 109 (2-0); Zak 78 (1-1)</strong></p>
