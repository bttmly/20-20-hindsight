<p>While I agree with Nick&#8217;s decision (accidental or purposeful) that my matchup this week didn&#8217;t deserve a recap, shit just didn&#8217;t feel right without someone talking about my promising team after Week 1. Seeing as Dave has paved the way for guest submissions, I&#8217;ll lend my thoughts to what happened last week:</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>This one was over after Thursday. And it&#8217;s too bad too because shit gets <span><em>real</em></span> in this house when Jenny and I go head to head in fantasy. No spooning, no favors, no cordiality. I&#8217;m a straight-up dick, and Jenny is no better. But this week, Jenny almost, in a totally emasculating way, felt bad for me and her lack of rubbing in her embarrassing win made it an awful week. What&#8217;s worse, because we have 14 teams, I won&#8217;t get a chance to recapture my fantasy manhood until next season (or the playoffs).  </p>
<p>Until DeSean Jackson&#8217;s promising 16pt performance Monday night (7 catches for 104 and a TD), Peyton was almost able to beat my entire team by himself. You can&#8217;t come back against a Thursday Night, 60&#160;pt performance and I am okay with that. I am actually happy that my team didn&#8217;t put up 100+ fp because I wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to waste a good performance on a no-win situation. Anyway, we all saw Peyton&#8217;s performance. It doesn&#8217;t look like there are any lingering neck issues there. One concern going forward is how he is going to spread to the love to his 4 stud receiving targets (fuck the backfield, I&#8217;ll get to that in a minute). Beyond Peyton, Jenny had 5 other positions putting up double digit points, with AJ Green and Anquan Boldin each putting up over 25. It&#8217;s not surprising to see AJ Green put up a monster performance, who led the Bengals in every offensive receiving category (targets, yards, catches, and TDs). But it&#8217;s less certain that Boldin can repeat that performance as the season progresses. Unless some of the other 49er receivers pose a serious counter threat, Boldin will be smothered by opposing teams&#8217; top corners and, with his old, frail legs and body, it is doubtful he can wrangle in over triple digit yards each week. Lacy is also likely to be the odd-man out on a passing-heavy offense. If the Packers can bring balance to their offense though, Lacy could emerge as one of the better RBs the Packers have had in a few years. He looked dominant against a tough 49er defensive line, but also struggled with ball control issues and decisionmaking ability. He is a definitely question mark moving forward.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard Nick over and over and over again describe Max&#8217;s WRs as the best of 2011, but I&#8217;d have to say that Jenny&#8217;s team is living in the past right there with Max&#8217;s WRs. Boldin, Colston, Olsen, and Mendenhall have all seen better days. If they can stay healthy over the length of the season, they all play on dynamic offenses capable of putting up a lot of points in a hurry. But if they can&#8217;t, Jenny is really lacking depth on her bench, and knowing that she really struggles to stay up past 10:30pm, it&#8217;s going to be hard for her to put in her bids on the waiver wire. Anyway, her team had a monster performance and there&#8217;s no way to cut it that will prove otherwise. Her true test will be to continue the dominance week in and week out. </p>
<p>Besides getting beat by 82 points (7 less than my total for the week), I am encouraged by some of the things my team did. Drew Brees will be there for me every week unless he gets injured. Week 1 was no different and put up a respectable 23 points. One of the things that I am most juiced about is the Brees-Graham combination. As everyone knows, Graham is a monster and one of Brees&#8217; favorite targets when the Saints get in the red zone. I can&#8217;t wait for those double-TD plays going forward. Stevan Ridley was actually running well before he put the ball on the ground, rushing for 46 yards on 9 carries (5.1YPC) against a porous Buffalo D. But after he got careless with the ball in the 2nd quarter, he didn&#8217;t see a carry the rest of the game. And with Shane Vareen not set to return until Week 11, the Pats are forced to go back to Ridley. Antonio Brown should see his targets as the Steelers&#8217; clear No. 1 WR. There&#8217;s a question about the Steelers&#8217; O line going forward, but I&#8217;m confident that Brown will be able to make something out of almost-nothing. DeSean Jackson seems to love Chip Kelly&#8217;s style of offense (See: <a href="http://thebiglead.com/2013/09/09/chip-kelly-had-his-visor-knocked-off-by-an-excited-desean-jackson/">http://thebiglead.com/2013/09/09/chip-kelly-had-his-visor-knocked-off-by-an-excited-desean-jackson/</a>) and with his speed, seems poised to be heavily involved in the fast-paced offensive in the coming weeks. I have 2/3 of the RBs in Denver, so if Adam Gase can figure his shit out, we&#8217;ll be good (and if he picks Ronnie Hillman, whom Hooper just picked up, I&#8217;ll go on a murderous rampage). </p>
<p>I got fucked week 1 (figuratively, less so in reality), but I am excited for Week 2. </p>
