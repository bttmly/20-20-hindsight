While he put up his eighth 3+ TD game of the season, he lost a fumble and wound up a yard shy of 300 passing which is disappointing from a fantasy perspective, especially in a close matchup. Perhaps the biggest surprise was Frank Gore, who only managed to amass 88 yards on 24 carries with no scores. Dave continued to go all-in on the Chargers backs and got burned. But the biggest blunder here was not Dave&#8217;s lineup choices but rather the on-field missteps by his players. DeSean Jackson had a big catch that was wiped out on offsetting penalties, including his taunting of the Giants&#8217; defensive coordinator by flipping the ball at him and dusting himself off. Then Aaron Hernandez, playing on Monday night with a shot to seal the matchup for Dave, dropped one TD pass and had another called back on penalty. Adding to the misery was his other tight end, Vernon Davis, who had 12 on Dave&#8217;s bench. As for my team, nothing special really. Marshawn Lynch continued to be pleasantly surprising; he grabbed 14 points and extended his TD streak to 4 games. Recently acquired Willis McGahee stunk it up with 12 carries for 18 yards and a fumble. Steven Jackson was uninspiring as was Jermichael Finley.<br/><!-- more --><br/><strong>LINC 128 (4-7); JUIC 45 (4-7)</strong><br/>Jenny&#8217;s team was extremely impressive this week and was helped by the fact that she set didn&#8217;t check her team for a week and somehow ended up with a perfect roster. While Torrey Smith was the only one who exceeded 20, thanks to an amazing touchdown catch against the Titans, all her players besides NY Jets kicker Nick Folk got into double digits. Percy Harvin found his rhythm with Ponder and grabbed 6 balls for 73 yards and a score, and Roddy White took advantage of Julio Jones&#8217; absence with 7 catches for 147. Andy Dalton had a respectable 17, though his three interceptions were painful. Conversely ZM&#8217;s team just sucked. Only LeSean McCoy had double digits and it was just a meager 11. Sanchez was overmatched by the Eagles defense, barely hitting 250 yards passing with no TDs and a pick. While there was no way to avoid this beating, ZM could have mitigated it. Christian Ponder and Alex Smith both rode the pine with 21. And starting Kendall Hunter over James Starks seems like insanity to me. He&#8217;s playing me this week and I plan to avenge my week 6 loss.<br/><br/><strong>BREH 99 (7-4); MARC 76 (4-7)</strong><br/>Pat has to be really happy about his two gym rats&#8217; performances this week. Jordy Nelson has simply been on fire this season, and in an unpredictable Packers passing distribution he&#8217;s the closest thing to a sure thing. The guy only has three single digit games all season and he&#8217;s got NINE touchdown catches. Now lets talk Gronk. The guy is a physical monster and, surprisingly, can move very well in open space. On MNF he had his fourth 2 TD game of the season, which was also his fourth 20+ fantasy day. At the beginning of the season it looked like a fluke, now Gronkowski looks like Brady&#8217;s new best friend. Joe Flacco was also decent, throwing for 2 touchdowns (include the aforementioned dime to Torrey Smith), 270 yards and a pick. The rest of the team was pedestrian, including Wes Welker and Calvin Johnson who combined for just 10. Pat even left Dez Bryant on the bench&#8230; seriously this guy has way too many solid WR options. Lucky for him things are going from bad to worse for Jordan, who left huge points on the bench. Jay Cutler, Steve Smith and Cedric Benson were all impressive. Leading his squad is the sinking USS Philip Rivers, showing no signs of a late turnaround. And AP is hurt for probably the rest of the fantasy season – those high ankle sprains tend to take a while.<br/><br/><strong>HUH? 82 (5-6); MS 74 (4-7)</strong><br/>Doesn&#8217;t it suck when someone like Nate Washington goes off? The guy has had some decent games this season but they&#8217;ve been too few and too far between (although I do think he&#8217;s a better play than Mike Williams). Then Hasselbeck gets hurt and Washington displays some serious chemistry with Jake Locker, who threw both Titans TDs. Cam Newton put up more big numbers in another big loss. Although the Panthers gave back a game they should have closed out against a (initially) struggling Matt Stafford, Cam still got his: 280 yards passing and 3 total TDs. But his FOUR interceptions cost both Carolina and AJ the matchup. Ali is trying to make a late season surge but things are working against him. Early season star Fred Jackson is hurt, and his Felix Jones pickup doesn&#8217;t look to be panning out. On the other hand, Antonio Gates is finally doing something and Jabar Gaffney loves Rex Grossman. We&#8217;ll see if he can bounce back but I think the running back corps, aside form Sproles, will derail him.<br/><br/><strong>ZAK 120 (3-8); SPAU 72 (4-6-1)</strong><br/>Zak finally got the performance he&#8217;s been looking for all season. While Brady barely limped to 20 fantasy points, everyone else picked up the slack. MJD and Michael Bush have been an excellent one-two punch in the RB slots and they continued to roll this week with a combined 33. Jonathan Stewart was solid in the passing game and Sidney Rice found the end zone for the first time since week 4. But by far the biggest boost was the Patriots D/ST which was all over the Chief (unsurprising given their QB situation). The unit grabbed 3 interceptions, held the Chiefs to 3 points and scored a punt return TD. By the way, did you see that guy Julian Edelman!? He played on all sides of the ball that game. He returned the punt for a TD, played cornerback in dime sets and lined up at wide receiver. Plus <a href="http://espn.go.com/new-york/nfl/story/_/id/7176933/new-england-patriots-julian-edelman-arrested-nightclub-incident">he gets people ejected from clubs when they don&#8217;t like being groped</a>, and that&#8217;s baller. Everything Zak&#8217;s team did, Andre&#8217;s team did not. Matt Stafford was extremely impressive in a huge bounce-back game. He opened with two picks, but then decided that he simply was not going to lose. He ended with 5 touchdowns (all to different receivers, none to Calvin Johnson) and 335 yards passing and 39 fantasy points. Nobody else on Andre&#8217;s team had double digits, including Chris Johnson who slid back in to mediocrity after his &#8220;breakout&#8221; performance in week 10. As for Eric Decker, who has been decent even with Tebow, it became clear that those numbers couldn&#8217;t last with a QB who struggles to heave ducks down the field. <br/><br/><strong>TUSK 112 (8-3); TWS 83 (10-1)</strong><br/>FINALLY! I put off writing this one until last since it will be the most enjoyable. If you don&#8217;t understand the picture at the top, suck it. If you do, tell me how dope it would be to ride <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Game_of_Thrones_pedicab.jpg">this shit</a> around to bars for a night? Anyway, away from fantasy books/TV shows and back to fantasy football. Eli finally showed his old <a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CSo9zR28lOo/Ts1DkOZenHI/AAAAAAAAACM/vUQNvgixPCI/s912/butters.jpg">Butters</a> self and blew it against the Eagles. Expect more Eli mediocrity down the stretch as the Giants pull their routine second-half collapse. Forte was simply bad, gaining just 57 yards on 20 carries, and didn&#8217;t get the goal line look either time. Marion Barber took one while Cutler snuck in the other. Victor Cruz and Tony Gonzalez were solid, each catching a touchdown. However the injury and bye situation was rough and Max will likely blame this blemish on that. Arian Foster and Marques Colston were both on bye while McFlockka was hobbled on the sidelines, as was AJ Green. Nonetheless, Phil put up some big time numbers in this beatdown. First, it&#8217;s November. If you&#8217;ve watched more than six or seven minutes of ESPN this month, you know that November is Tony Romo Month. I guess it&#8217;s cool that he plays like an elite quarterback for one month a year! Anyway&#8230; He continued his November dominance with 3 touchdowns and no picks in an overtime win against the &#8216;Skins. Ray Rice continued to roll with 2 TDs and 147 yards from scrimmage. Vincent Jackson bounced back strong over a controversial game in Oakland last week; he grabbed 7 balls for 165 and a score against the Bears. And OBVIOUSLY the Niners defense handled business against the Cardinals – allowing just 1 TD and piling up 5 takeaways. The rest of the squad was pedestrian but it didn&#8217;t matter. <br/><br/>Happy Thanksgiving everybody! Get ready to piss off your families by watching 3 games back-to-back.</p>
