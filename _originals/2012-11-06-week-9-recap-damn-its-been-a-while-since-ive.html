<div class="intro">
<p class="body-copy">Damn, it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve been able to get one of these out on Tuesday. YOU&#8217;RE WELCOME. I&#8217;m also preparing a list of some notable draft busts, surprise stars, injury disaster, and free agent gems for later this week so check back around Thursday.</p>
<p>Here are your week 9 recaps.</p>
</div>
<div class="read-more closed">
<div>
    <span class="matchup-names">Hooper v. Phil</span>
    <span class="matchup-teams">THE WHOLE WORLD IS A COUCH v. THE BAUCE OF SAUCE</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">Largely thanks to Doug Martin, Hoop rolled up a rediculous 157 FP this week, and it could have been a lot more. Think about this: 151 of those points came from just six roster spots; he got minimal production out of Kenny Britt, Antonio Brown, and Santana Moss. Moss and Brown both suffered injuries on Sunday–high ankle sprain and concussion respectively. Britt&#8217;s numbers would have looked better, and Hoop would have hit the 160-point mark, had he not had the ball <a href="http://i.minus.com/iOvZQ3WbvueuY.gif">punched out of his hands</a> by Charles Tillman (more on this monster later) on the Titans&#8217; first play from scrimmage. Let&#8217;s not overlook Aaron Rodgers or Adrian Peterson though who notched 32 and 31 against defenses supposedly strong against their positions. Arizona&#8217;s pass defense, vaunted earlier in the year, has fallen off steeply and Rodgers put the finishing touches on their demise. How many other guys on the planet could make <a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/green-bay-packers/0ap2000000089681/Cobb-catches-his-second-touchdown">this throw</a>? In Seattle, Adrian Peterson abused the formidable Seahawks run defense to the tune of 182 yards and two scores on just 17 carries. Although they started the year as one of the league&#8217;s best units against the run the Seahakws are now down to 11th in rushing defense. Elsewhere on Hoop&#8217;s roster, Jimmy Graham looks to be nearing full health after battling a lingering ankle problem for the past few weeks. All systems are go for Hooper, who put a stranglehold on the top playoff seed by advancing to 7-2 this week. He&#8217;s reeled off six straight wins after starting 1-2. Maybe that has something to do with Rodgers avergaing 15 FPPG over the first three and a staggering 32 FPPG over the last six. Maybe?</p>
<p class="body-copy">Phil&#8217;s team had a good outing, but there isn&#8217;t really a combination of players one team could reasonably have that could have beaten Martin, Rodgers, and AP this week. Phil used Andrew Luck as a bye week fill-in for Brady and he came through big time, setting the rookie single game passing yards record (433) and also throwing two scores with zero picks (29 FP). Mikel Leshoure found the endzone three times to go along with his 70 yards rushing for 25 FP. Randall Cobb was on the receiving end of two of Rodgers&#8217; four touchdowns (check the link above) and finished with 17 FP. But despite putting up 118 he got smoked by nearly 40 points. Phil gets Brady back next week but Greg Jennings&#8217; uncertain recovery timetable from <a href="http://nbcoutofbounds.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/a6ojrjfcaaegjnm.jpg?w=450&amp;h=600">surgery</a> is still troubling.</p>
<p class="scoreboard">Hooper 157 (7-2); Phil 118 (5-4)</p>

    <span class="matchup-names">Zak v. Pat</span>
    <span class="matchup-teams">TOWN TAXES v. CHAIN GANG</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">Tough break for Pat on this one; he was up 46 going into Sunday night with Michael Turner (in SNF), Drew Brees and DeSean Jackson (in MNF) to go for Zak. Brees can put up 30+ by himself–he&#8217;s done so three times this season so far–so this one was definitely still in play. Regardless, it&#8217;s rough to see a huge lead like that erased. Turner had a very nice outing on Sunday night against the Cowboys, going for 102 yards and a score on 20 carries (16 FP). He&#8217;s continued to defy expectations of a falloff, and has been fairly solid all season. He&#8217;s only averaging 4.0 yards per carry, down significantly from his 4.5 last season, but has five total touchdowns through eight games despite a substantially reduced workload. He&#8217;s on pace for just under 260 carries after getting 301 last year. Zak has been getting good production out of Chris Johnson (14 FP this week) since he acquired him from Max, but he lucked big time this week. On his second-to-last carry of the game, deep in garbage time in a 51-12 rout, Johnson ripped off an 80-yard touchdown run. To that point in the game Johnson had 14 carries for 60 yards and two fumbles lost for net zero points. So his entire fantasy production for the game, 80 yards plus a touchdown for 14 points, came on a single play. Points count no matter how you earn them, but if you&#8217;re looking for consistency going forward that&#8217;s not a promising sign. Then again, Johnson won&#8217;t have Charles Tillman punching balls out of his hands every game either. Zak still had 30 points to make up on MNF and it didn&#8217;t look promising for most of the game. The Saints were doing things a.) they haven&#8217;t done well so far this year and b.) make a Brees owner cringe: running the ball and scoring on defense. New Orleans piled up 140 rushing yards on the night after averaging barely half that for the season and scored only their third rushing touchdown by a running back this season. They also scored on a 99-yard pick six for their first defensive score of the season. Brees would finish with two touchdowns and a respectable 18 FP, although that total is his second lowest of the season–he had 17 last week. On the other side of the ball, the Eagles made a concerted effort to work in DeSean Jackson including an incomplete bomb on the opening play of the game. He caught an 18-yard pass on the next play and a five-yarder later in the first half but the back breaker was a 77-yard score near the middle of the second quarter. Jackson finished with 16–with 13 from that play alone–and sealed it for Zak. This one strikes me as a little less fluky than CJ&#8217;s 80-yard run against the Bears defense, as Jackson has all ways been a boom-or-bust deep threat, but this entire matchup was decided on two guys making one play each that netted a combined 27 FP. Actually, it was decided on three plays&#8230; read on.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Obviously this was another disappointing loss for Pat. On the bright side, Marshawn Lynch did well (20 FP) and put to bed the notion that Minnesota&#8217;s defense is anything to fear. Things were pretty bleak other than that. After a torrid start Tony Gonzalez has cooled off lately, with just 4, 2, and 3 FP in the last three outings. Alfred Morris as seen a similar dip with just 5 and 7 in the last two after reaching double digits in six of the previous seven games. Calvin Johnson had a big yardage (129 yards, 12 FP) day but continued his end zone drought. Stafford and Johnson hooked up for 16 touchdowns last year but have 0 through eight games this season (Johnson&#8217;s lone TD came from backup Shaun Hill). Incidentally, he&#8217;s also tied for fourth in the NFL in dropped passes with six so far this season. Last night <a href="http://blogs.detroitlions.com/2012/11/05/johnson-has-been-oh-so-close-to-five-more-touchdowns-this-year/">the Lions blog noted</a> that Megatron has been tackled within two yards of the opposing goal line <em>five</em> times this season, including a tackle on the 1-yard line after a 38-yard gain on Sunday. In a matchup decided by four points, that stings.</p>
<p class="scoreboard">Zak 88 (6-3); Pat 84 (3-6)</p>

    <span class="matchup-teams">CHOMO SE DICE: SALSA CON QUESO v. NO WORK TODAY</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">Peyton Manning&#8230; damn. Although The Sheriff did throw a pair of picks he continued a now-five game streak with three passing scores, while just barely missing 300 yards. The Broncos have looked shaky at times, but every team in the AFC besides Houston has too. The Broncos might be leigt AFC championship game contenders and it would be awesome to see Brady/Manning in the playoffs yet again. Peyton is the third highest scoring QB in fantasy, behind only Rodgers and Brees, and has led Ali&#8217;s team to three straight wins. The big surprise here was the Chargers D/ST which has been completely mediocre in fantasy this season&#8230; when not playing the Chiefs. The Chiefs are so incredibly bad against opposing D/ST it&#8217;s almost unbelievable. Take this example: the Saints are the worst against opposing QBs, allowing an average of 23.9 FPPG against a league average of 16.8. That&#8217;s about a 42% increase in production, which is huge. Now take the Chiefs against D/ST: they allow 19.5 on average while the league as a whole gives up just 8.6–a 126% increase. They&#8217;ve had three or more turnovers in all but one game&#8230; when they had two, one of which was returned for a touchdown. They&#8217;ve given up five defensive and special teams scores on the season, behind only Tennessee and Detroit who have each allowed six. No D/ST has scored less than 11 against them, and that&#8217;s a group which includes only mediocre or worse defenses. In other spots on Ali&#8217;s roster recent trends continued. Jamaal Charles had another head-scratcher with just 39 yards on 12 attempts before being sidelined with an injury. Mike Williams had another decent day with a TD and he&#8217;s now found the end zone three of the last four weeks and five times total. While he doesn&#8217;t get monster yards, he does have five straight games with at least four catches. Victor Cruz had an off day after being <a href="http://thebiglead.fantasysportsven.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cruz-hit-11-4-12.gif">leveled in the end zone by Ryan Clark</a> but he should be fine going forward. But both MJD and Darren Sproles are out indefinitely with injury–many believe Jones-Drew could miss the rest of the season. Sproles might be able to come back in two or three weeks but until then Ali will have to ride with LaRod Stephens-Howling as RB2 which is certainly not a recipe for success.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Nothing has gone AJ&#8217;s way this season. Brandon Lloyd has been a bust so far, more of a decoy than an actual threat. Fred Jackson&#8217;s early injury opened the door for CJ Spiller and they&#8217;re now in a 50-50 timeshare. DeMarco Murray hasn&#8217;t made any appreciable progress since his foot injury. The Law Firm was supposed to be a touchdown machine for the Bengals but even after getting one this past week he has only three on the season. And Percy Harvin sprained his ankle, apparently in <em>three</em> places. That sounds not good.</p>
<p class="scoreboard">Ali 96 (5-4); AJ 60 (2-7)</p>

    <span class="matchup-names">Max v. Dave</span>
    <span class="matchup-teams">FUCK YOU AARON SORKIN v. THAT&#8217;S NO MOON</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">In last week&#8217;s recap (maybe the one before that) I noted Max likely needs 35+ from Brandon Marshall and Matt Forte combined to win any matchup. He got 50 from them this week and walked away with the W. Granted, he also had big contributions elsewhere, most notably from pickup-and-start QB Carson Palmer (33 FP). Reggie Bush reached the endzone and double digits for just the second time in the last six weeks–his ferocious start almost seems like last season at this point. AJ Green refuses to be held out of the end zone; he extended his scoring streak to seven games and was just a yard shy of the century mark. While Max is way behind the pack with a 3-6 record he&#8217;s a dangerous spoiler who can put up big numbers.</p>
<p class="body-copy">In the Ali/AJ recap I talked about how bad KC is against opposing D/ST. Man, I wish they played Chicago this year. Given their respective numbers the Bears D/ST should score 50 (22.4 avg * [1+1.26]). Against the Titans on Sunday the Chicago D/ST put up 32 despite allowing a garbage time TD to Chris Johnson (see above), thanks to five takeaways and a score on defense and one on special teams. Charles &#8220;Peanut&#8221; Tillman forced four fumbles himself, an NFL record. And if you haven&#8217;t seen the Brian Urlacher pick-six go <a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-cant-miss-plays/0ap2000000089636/WK-9-Can-t-Miss-Play-Urlacher-pick-six">watch it ASAP</a>. It&#8217;s surreal (and hilarious) to see someone carrying the ball in the NFL moving that slowly. Also, Hasselbeck, just don&#8217;t even try to get in his way next time. The Bears have played some bad offenses this year but what they&#8217;re doing on defense still defies explanation. I&#8217;m interested to see what happens this week against the Texans, against whom D/ST units are averaging just 2.8 FP. The Bears D/ST has been by far Dave&#8217;s MVP this year, and they&#8217;re actually averaging more points per game than RG3. Ridiculous right? But in a week where your D/ST is your top scorer, and your kicker is second, you might have a problem. Stafford followed up his 36-point &#8220;breakout&#8221; game last week with an 11-point fantasy stinker. Though the Lions mauled the Panthers in the Big Cat Showdown, their four touchdowns were all scored on the ground. Stafford was efficient IRL (22-33, 66.77%, 285 yds.) but you need more than 11 FP from a first-round draft pick. Trent Richardson, Larry Fitzgerald, James Jones and Antonio Gates all hit low double-digits which is encouraging (I guess) despite the loss.</p>

    <span class="matchup-names">ZM v. Brian</span>
    <span class="matchup-teams">ORANGE COUNTY GUNNERS v. WE GOT NICKS LIKE JESUS</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">There&#8217;s nobody on ZM&#8217;s team I want to talk about in depth because just about everyone of them is thoroughly uninteresting. Cam: inconsistent and regressing. LeSean: under-used with an awful line. Andre Johnson: past his prime. Jonathan Stewart: timeshare. Mike Wallace: not living up to pre-season expectations. The only guy I find interesting is Vincent Jackson who is playing in an offense that has been quietly great over the past four games. I wish I could watch this guy more. I can&#8217;t tell if defenses are just ceding two or three long balls to him every game, or if he is actually making great plays. Either way, he has the highest yards per catch average in the NFL (22.9) and is eighth in receiving yards despite having just 31 receptions. Admittedly, he&#8217;s been targeted 70 times (44.3% catch rate) but completion percentage on long throws is usually pretty low. Jackson&#8217;s prowess with the deep ball allows the Bucs to be dangerous all over the field, with Mike Williams and Doug Martin doing great work elsewhere. Tampa Bay is averaging 28.3 points per game this season, and <em>36</em> over their last four (albeit against some very shaky defenses). Further, their four losses were each by 7 or fewer points. Keep an eye on these guys; at 4-4 they&#8217;re unlikely to make a run at the last NFC playoff spot (the Bears or Packers will take the first one) but they could make some noise down the stretch. Anyway, ZM put up a solid 94 this week and won this matchup handily.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Brian can&#8217;t seem to field a healthy squad. Like, ever. Hakeem Nicks is finally (allegedly) healthy but managed just a single fantasy point this week. But the injury bug has struck Brian&#8217;s leading backs, with Darren McFadden suffering a high ankle sprain early against Tampa Bay and Ahmad Bradshaw still dealing with foot issues. It doesn&#8217;t help that the Giants seem to favor Andre Brown near the goal line. Jermichael Finley is terrible <em>and</em> hurt. Even McFadden&#8217;s backup Mike Goodson, who is on Brian&#8217;s roster, got hurt Sunday. He needs to make some major changes ASAP, and he has some personnel on the bench that could be promising. As mentioned above the Tampa offense is on fire and Brian is sitting on Freeman who should be started over Roethlisberger at this point. Freeman&#8217;s FP over the past four games: 28, 35, 38, 20. Big Ben: 18, 13, 26, 14. Do the math. Finley is fit for the scrapheap and either of Brians other two TEs would be adequate replacements. Sidney Rice has quietly found the end zone in three of the last four games and warrants a second look. Brian isn&#8217;t out of the hunt yet but if he doesn&#8217;t move on from his draft busts soon he will be. Also, for God&#8217;s sake, take a dip in the free agent pool! Brian has a grand total of six acquisitions this year, second lowest behind Jenny (three).</p>

<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">Matty Ice and Arian Foster both had rather disappointing days. While the Dallas defense has been surprisingly stingy against quarterbacks, Foster had the best possible matchup and only 111 yards on 24 carries. I said it before: Houston isn&#8217;t as efficient on the ground as most people think. Bitching about a 17-point day from a running back may seem whiny but this is supposedly the best back in the league against the worst run defense. More aggravating was the awfulness of Willis McGahee and Ryan Mathews who managed just six each. Their combined stats: 36 carries, 133 yards (3.7 avg); 3 catches, 9 yards. Yuck. Anyway, Julio Jones managed to string together two consecutive double digit days for the first time this season, while Reggie Wayne reached double-digits for the first time since his 27-point week five outburst against Green Bay. With 20 combined from kicker and D/ST I was still in decent position going into MNF where Jenny had Maclin and Colston going.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Jenny has now appropriately changed her name to &#8220;Eli You&#8217;re Killing Me&#8221; which tells you most of what you need to know about her side of this matchup. A pathetic outing from Eli put her in a bad spot for the second straight week; he managed just 2 FP this week after 4 FP last week. Ray Rice ran well (15 FP) but Isaac Redman was the star. With Rashard Mendenhall and Jonathan Dwyer out with injuries, Redman made hay on Sunday with 26 carries for 147 yards and a score (20 FP). Owen Daniels found the endzone for the fifth time this season–did you know he&#8217;s second among TEs in fantasy points? But the Eli disaster left her down 20 going into MNF. With a guy like Colston this is still doable territory if Maclin kicks in a little. Ultimately they only got twelve combined, largely thanks to a 1-yard TD catch by Colston and I was able to hang on for the win.</p>
<p class="scoreboard">Nick 94 (6-3); Jenny 86 (5-4)</p>
