<p>First off, nice work on the website Nick. It&#8217;s way better than posting on ESPN&#8217;s page. Dave, your analysis of Nick&#8217;s draft was hilarious. The GIFs were priceless and I laughed out loud upon reading buttsola. Has anything in the past 6 years been funnier than buttsola? I seriously doubt it. Also, in regards to Paul&#8217;s team name, its from the NFL fantasy football commercial I think.Â </p>

<p>Second, I know we are all just as juiced as this guy that football is back&#8230;</p>

<p><em>[Ed. Note: Ali, you realize this guy (Joseph Fauria) went to UCLA, right?]</em></p>
<p>&#8230;lesbereal footballs the best. That being said the A&#8217;s have been gettin me so juiced! I&#8217;m kinda bummed they already whooped up the Twins today&#8230;now what am I gonna do in class? Oh yeah, post on this blog. Are the A&#8217;s gonna win it all this year? I don&#8217;t know, but they&#8217;ve been playing great and Jarrod Parker&#8217;s Jarret Jackesque mustache and the fatty chaws he packs got me freaking out&#8230;</p>

<p>Lastly, I gotta give AJ a shoutout for putting me on Stag&#8217;s Lunchette on 17th St. in Oakland. The sandos there GO HITP. Most recently I had a duck bacon melt. It was soooo un-buttsola</p>
