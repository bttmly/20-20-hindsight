		<p class="body-copy">As I mentioned last week, Max&#8217;s slim playoff hopes were predicated on Jenny and ZM both losing. That didn&#8217;t happen. As for me, I&#8217;ve secured the third seed but I&#8217;m not real optimistic about the playoffs. For starters, two of my draft steals, Matt Ryan and Reggie Wayne, have fallen off after torrid starts. All teams have played 12 games at this point so a lot of the analysis will be weeks 1-6 versus weeks 7-13. Matt Ryan had an incredible first six games and was the early season MVP favorite. In his last six, however, he&#8217;s been merely average. His FPPG has crashed from 23.2 to 16.2. That&#8217;s not awful, but it&#8217;s Joe Flacco territory. Reggie Wayne was phenomenal early in the year with 12.2 FPPG over the first six. Since then he&#8217;s managed 8.8. That drop isn&#8217;t as precipitous as Ryan&#8217;s but it has corresponded with QB Andrew Luck&#8217;s rising confidence in his other receivers, namely TY Hilton and Donnie Avery. Wayne is still the go-to guy, but the Colts have more o ptions now. Further, the season ending injury to Willis McGahee and the ineffectiveness of Ryan Matthews have thinned my RB corps. Finally, I&#8217;m also sitting on Julio Jones and Torrey Smith. Both are fantasically talented but their erratic output is worrisome. On the bright side, Bryce Brown has been absolutely crushing it and Brandon Myers&#8217;s recent success may help me shore up the tight end position, which has been my team&#8217;s liability all year.</p>

		<p class="body-copy">Both of these teams enter the playoffs with inauspicious sub-80 point performances. And, UCLA-Stanford style, they&#8217;ll be playing each other again this week in the first round. Biggest thing to note here was Brady&#8217;s surprisingly ineffectual performance against Miami (12 FP). The Pats are more comforatble running the ball than they have in recent years, and that fact has the potential to torpoedo Brady&#8217;s production in any one game. That said, he&#8217;s still the top scoring QB and is on an offense that has a chance to be historically prolific. On the other hand, Phil should be happy with Mikel Leshoure, who is getting more looks close to the goal line than anyone expected. The return of Greg Jennings also bodes well. Dave is in a little trouble, despite pulling out this narrow win. Jordy Nelson will likely miss next week&#8217;s game, and Justin Blackmon has turned back into a pumpkin. Still, he hangs his hat on his RBs and they&#8217;re doing fine. If the Bears D/ST gets back on track he has a chance to hand Phil back-to-back defeats and a ticket to the spectators&#8217; box for the rest of the fantasy playoffs.</p>

		<p class="body-copy">AJ capped off a thoroughly disappointing season in typical fashion. Note the three terrible performances from three guys who were widely hyped in the preseason: Brandon Lloyd (1 FP), Brandon LaFell (1 FP), and Jacquizz Rodgers (4 FP). Ali and Max&#8217;s playoff hopes were hanging on AJ&#8217;s ability to knock off ZM but this one wasn&#8217;t even close. Incredibly, ZM enters the playoff as the second lowest scoring team on the season, averaging just 83.5 points per week. But he&#8217;s also riding an absurd five game win streak. While he&#8217;s put up good numbers each week, those victories have come over teams scoring 62, 77, 43, 73, and 69. He&#8217;s unlikely to face such a generous slate in the playoffs. Still, the dramatic second half improvement of Cam Newon and Andre Johnson gives him reason for hope. I plan to crush that hope into dust this weekend.</p>

		<p class="body-copy">Must have been a tense week over at Casa Linchey/Welsh. After Brees dropped a 5 INT stinker on Thursday night it looked like Jenny would sail to a win and a playoff spot. But then Wes Welker posted his best game in seven weeks, and Demaryius Thomas put up his best outing of the entire season. Kyle Rudolph chipped in his third straight double-digit performance, and the ballsy decision to start the Jets D/ST paid off with 12 FP. Meanwhile, Jenny&#8217;s team was in a tailspin. Julian Edelman got hurt early and is now on the IR. Bilal Powell was second fiddle to Shonn Greene&#8230; who was on the bench. Beanie Wells was hilariously awful - 22 yards on 15 carries - and also suffered an injury. This against the miserable Jets defense. To add insult to injury, she had guys on the bench - notably, Golden Tate - who could have won this one.</p>

		<p class="body-copy">Brian is second in disaster only to AJ. But Brian&#8217;s collapse over the past few weeks has to be more painful as he was a contender before his ignominious five-game slide, capped off by this epic beating. Brian has had a miserable combination of bad decision-making and poor luck. We&#8217;ll get back to this in the post-season recap, but just to give you an idea of the depths of his misery: Darren McFadden and Hakeem Nicks were his first and second round picks. In the 24 total games, they&#8217;ve combined to miss six, score five or fewer in nine, and produce just one 20+ game (Nicks in week 2). As for Hoop&#8230; goddamn. In 13 games he&#8217;s scored 120+ FP six times. Six. Admittedly, Aaron Rodgers has been more erratic, and less productive, than advertised. But AP&#8217;s incredible, ridiculous, unprecedented, [out of adjectives] season has cured all ills. He&#8217;s the top scoring RB going into the playoffs. Look, it would be easy to say Hoop lucked out with the first pick and that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s the top scoring team. But it&#8217;s not true. Rodgers hasn&#8217;t matched (not even close) his superlative 2011 season, and has not justifed the first overall pick. Obviously nobody foresaw RG3&#8217;s fantasy dominance, but the fact is that Rodgers is being out-performed in fantasy by a guy who went in the ninth round. Still, Hoop has been extraordinarily savvy this year. Sorry to cut this short - Hoop, I&#8217;ll shower you with praise in the epic COMPREHENSIVE 2012 FANTASY RETROSPECTIVE - but it was a rough day at work and there are beers that need drinking.</p>
