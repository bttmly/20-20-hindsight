<p><strong><span>LINC  80 (3-4); TUSK 79 (5-2)</span></strong><span><br/>The  electric Brees/Graham combo linked up for six catches and two  touchdowns (43 and 17 points respectively) on Sunday. Unfortunately for  Phil the rest of his team flatlined. In fact, Brees and Graham combined  for 60 points while his other seven starters gathered 19 combined. Ray  Rice couldn&#8217;t get anything going against the Jags, V-Jax was stuck on  Revis Island (1 grab on 8 targets), and Dwayne Bowe was back in single  digits for the first time since the opener. Still, take a look at those  names and you know this team will bounce back. The Saints get the Rams  next week, remember? Anyway, this game still came down to the wire. It  looked like an easy win going in to Monday night, with Phil down just 1  and with Ray Rice and kicker Billy Cundiff yet to go, against only  Torrey Smith. I expected this one to be locked up in the first quarter.  But the Jags weren&#8217;t ready to roll over, and through the first three  quarters they turned in perhaps the most impressive defensive  performance of any team this season. But the real story was two  sputtering offenses. They combined for 4-28 conversions on 3rd down. The  winning quarterback had a 59.0 rating and the losing one pegged a 61.0  effort. And there was a meager 351 yards of offense. That&#8217;s both passing and  rushing, <em>for both teams combined</em>. Still, Jenny came out on top,  benefitting from a missed field goal by Cundiff and a fumble lost by  Rice. She had decent performances from Schaub, Michael Turner and Roddy  White. Jenny also had the remarkable accomplishment of getting zero  combined from seven bench players (only the Eagles D/ST was on bye). I  expect Phil will keep winning for a while as his team looks like a  pretty clear third best, but this 79 point showing was definitely a  setback. Fun fact: all three 5-1 teams got their second loss this week.</span><span></span><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>DEM  52 (2-4-1); SPAU 52 (2-4-1)</span></strong><br/><span>Ties  are lame and this one was my fault since I didn&#8217;t set regular season  tiebreakers for the league. Next year I think we&#8217;ll do most bench points  as a tiebreaker. I suppose we are both lucky to get out a 52-point week  without a loss. I had big holes all through the middle of my roster:  Ryan Torain (0), Santana Moss (1) and Miles Austin (1). Torain was kind  of a risk given that the RB situation in Washington was unclear; going  forward he&#8217;ll (hopefully) be more effective as Sunday&#8217;s starter, Tim  Hightower, is out for the year with an ACL tear. Santana Moss left the  game with a broken hand and will miss 5 to 7 weeks; I&#8217;ll probably be  dropping him soon. He is now my third big(ish) name receiver to suffer a  multi-week injury, joining Andre Johnson (who may return this week) and  Julio Jones. The single point Miles Austin put up is what is staggering  and perplexing. Sure, Dallas has another monster pass-catcher in Dez  Bryant but where&#8217;s the love? To be fair, the Cowboys were manhandling  the Rams and they didn&#8217;t need to air it out. The two double digit  performances I got were pretty mediocre as well. Steven Jackson notched  his third straight double-digit fantasy game on 18 rushes for 70 yards  and a touchdown. But this production is simply not good enough for a  high second round pick. Matty Ice passed for 218, two picks and a  touchdown and rushed for another score in the Falcons upset of the  Lions. He suffered a gruesome looking injury when one of his own  offensive linemen stepped on his ankle as he set to deliver a pass, but  he miraculously was able to walk off the field by himself and return to  the game a couple plays later. Andre also had disappointing performances  this week, although he has only himself to blame for ending up in this  tie. He started kicker David Akers who was on bye.</span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>BREH  95 (5-2); JUIC (4-3) 104</span></strong><br/><span>ZM  got a big day from Greg Jennings, who put the team on his back &#8216;do with  20 (147 rec. yds., 1 TD). Sanchez also had a good fantasy day; although  he completed just 18 of 33 attempts for 173 yards, three of those  passes were touchdowns to Plaxico Burress. Also positive for ZM was the  31 combined he racked up from kicker and D/ST. The Seahawks D scored 16  in their snooze-fest 6-3 loss to the Browns. As for Pat, Vick was on bye  so he was forced to start Flacco who was just awful for the first three  quarters. When the Jags eventually loosened up their defense a little  to stop the big play, Flacco was able to put together a nice drive but  he still ended up with only 9 points on the week. Dez Bryant and Calvin  Johnson did well as usual, while Shonn Greene and Ben Tate both reached  double digits. Still, its hard to win when your QB nets you single  digits and this one was just out of reach by Monday night.</span><span></span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>HUH?  95 (3-4); WILL 92 (5-2)</span></strong><br/><span>Ali  came up with a big win this week, largely thanks to Ben Roethlisberger  (361 yds, 3 TD, 0 INT) who totted up 32 points this week. Darren Sproles  also had a huge game after sitting on two straight single digit days.  He ran 12 times for 88 yards and a score while catching six passes for  19 yards and another score. Unfortunately, Tim Hightower went down with a  knee injury and will be out for the season, denting Ali&#8217;s hopes that he  can continue to build on two straight wins. On the other hand, Antonio  Gates returned to action this week and seemed fairly effective so we&#8217;ll  see how things go here. As for Dave, the bye week hit hard as Frank  Gore, DeSean Jackson and Vernon Davis were out. Aaron Rodgers had  another impressive performance (335 yds. 3 TD, 0 INT) and Green Bay  kicker Mason Crosby put up 18 of his own but it just wasn&#8217;t enough to  get it done. Why he opted to play the Bucs D (against Chicago - 8  points) rather than the Saints D (against Indy - 16 points) is a mystery  – the Colts are 29th against defenses this year.</span><br/><span></span><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>TWS  125 (7-0); MARC 74 (1-6)</span></strong><br/><span>Max  put up 125 while having two players get zero. Ridiculous. Arian Foster  led the charge with colossal numbers: 115 yards and two scores rushing  on 25 carries, 119 yards and another score receiving on 5 catches.  Foster has come a LONG way this season, rebounding from an early injury  which hampered his performance and caused people (me!) to question the  wisdom of drafting him highly. It took a little while but this is the  Arian Foster of 2010. Matt Forte also put up big numbers as did Marques  Colston (and just about everybody else on the Saints). The Tebow story  you should already know. The troubling aspect of this game was that Max  lost Darren McFadden for an indeterminate amount of time early in the  Raiders big loss to the Chiefs. Incredibly, this still might be the best  team in the league without McFadden. Oh, by the way, Max had DeMarco  Murray (25 carries, 253 yards, 1 TD) sitting on the bench. For Jordan it  was more of the same. Some players did well but a bunch sucked so he  winds up with another loss. AP had 23 fantasy points (24 carries, 175  yards, 1 TD) and Steve Smith had 14 of his own (7 catches, 143 yards).  But Jay Cutler&#8217;s meager 11, combined with a pair of donuts and a pair of  guys with less than 5 made this match-up a 51 point blowout.</span><span></span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>ZAK  52 (1-6); MS 76 (1-6)</span></strong><br/><span>I  said above that it&#8217;s hard to win when you get single digits from your  quarterback. Well it&#8217;s even harder to win when you get negative points  from your signal caller. Without Tom Brady, we were all expecting Zak to  take a loss this week, and that&#8217;s exactly what happened when he picked  up Curtis Painter who had a truly awful day. He thew for just 67 yards  on 9 of 17 passing, lost a fumble, and tossed a pick-six. One piece of  good news for Zak is McFadden&#8217;s injury will mean more carries for  Michael Bush. That, and Brady will be on the field again next week. AJ  continued to ride the Cam Newton express to victory. Newton has 25+  fantasy points in five of his seven starts this season and has the  fourth highest average points per game among QBs with 25.1, behind only  Rodgers, Brees and Brady. Still, the win Sunday over the Redskins was  just the Panthers&#8217; second of the season. AJ needs some help from other  parts of his team if he wants to keep winning.    </span></p>
