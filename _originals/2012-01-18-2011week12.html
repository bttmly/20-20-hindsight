<p><em>Originally posted 11/30/11</em><br/><br/><strong>JUIC 105 (5-7); DEM 104 (5-6-1)</strong><br/>I&#8217;m going to take a minute here, or maybe an hour, to wallow in self-pity and despair by describing in excruciating detail the 5-day ordeal that hammered what is almost certainly the final nail into my fantasy football 2011 coffin. If you want to skip it go ahead. There&#8217;s some quick notes below on the other matchups, but, as a self-centered person, I spent the bulk of my time rehashing my own debacle.<br/><!-- more --><br/>Given the nature of NFL football on Thanksgiving weekend, the series of trials and tribulations that culminated on Monday Night Football began early Thursday morning. However the mistakes and miscalculations began even before that&#8230;<br/><br/>I had wrestled with my lineup all week. For my five WR and RB spots I had eight good-but-not-great options. Frankly none of these guy were absolute must-starts, but all had definite upside. I had already decided that Laurent Robinson would take one WR spot, as his general ability to be on the same page as Tony Romo was simply too tempting to pass up. However, the picture was muddied by the return from injury of two star wideouts, Andre Johnson and Julio Jones. I felt compelled to play at least one and had to decide largely on quarterback and matchup. Johnson was returning from an extremely lengthy absence and would be receiving passes from perennial underperformer Matt Leinart. It seemed certain that the Texans would play conservative football by relying on their excellent running game and defense. Furthermore, the Texans were facing off against the Jaguars, who despite their dismal record have actually been among the stingiest teams in the league against wide receivers. On the other hand, Julio Jones had missed just one full game. In his previous fully healthy performance he had solid chemistry with Matt Ryan; they hooked up 3 times for 131 yards and 2 TD. Plus with Ryan on my team the upside potential was huge, and their opponent, Minnesota, has allowed the second most points to wideouts this year. Also in the mix was Antonio Brown (WR; Steelers) who has been amazingly consistent in an understated way. He was averaging 6.5 catches/game in the four games preceding week 12, and hadn&#8217;t scored less than 8 points in any of those games. I eliminated Johnson form contention first as the QB situation was simply too precarious. And rather than go with a surefire 7-12 points from Antonio Brown, I reluctantly settled on Julio for the upside, which would ultimately cost my the matchup and my outside shot at the playoffs. <br/><br/>Not that anyone but me probably noticed, but over the course of this season my team has slowly transformed from WR-reliant to RB-reliant. This was partially out of necessity, since my star receivers (Julio Jones, Miles Austin, Andre Johnson) have missed a combined 12 games this season so far. Another factor was the midseason surge that both Marshawn Lynch and Steven Jackson experienced, and also because of my recent trade of Andy Dalton for Willis McGahee. I had also picked up Kevin Smith of the Detroit Lions after his monster 38-point week 11 breakout performance. I&#8217;m usually not one to jump on a one-hit wonder but there were a number of factors working in his favor.<br/><br/>- Jahvid Best was out with concussion indefinitely, which given his history both at Cal and in the NFL, meant probably the season. (This was later confirmed when he was placed on IR.)<br/>- Smith caught four passes in that game, which indicated to me that he would see action even if he wasn&#8217;t the primary runner. Plus the Lions would likely have to throw the rock to keep up with the Packers and Smith would be a great checkdown receiver. <br/>- He shared carries with Maurice Morris but was dramatically more productive in a yards/carry sense, and the split was 70/30 in his favor already so I expected that number to stay the same or improve.<br/>- The Lions seemed ready and willing to make him a major part of the offense.<br/><br/>Again, going for the upside, I settled on Kevin Smith first. The decision between Marshawn Lynch and Steven Jackson was harder. They seemed likely to score around the same number of points based on matchup (harder matchup for Steven Jackson who is a better player), but given the Rams&#8217; scoring inconsistencies I thought Jackson was likely to see more red-zone carries and targets. Also factoring into this decision was my uneasiness with Lynch&#8217;s recent success. He was on a 4 game TD streak and a 3 game streak of 14+ points, and had some intermittent success as a pass catcher. Given his history in the NFL I refused to believe this could continue for much longer and didn&#8217;t want to be in the passenger seat when the Beast Mode-mobile ran out of gas. So I settled on Steven Jackson. <br/><br/>The flex spot was still open with 3 contenders. I considered Lynch and Antonio Brown for the spot, but I was itching to start the recently-acquired Willis McGahee. He was fully healthy (unlike the previous two weeks) and given the Broncos new offense you <em>know</em> the guy is going to get 20+ touches. <br/><br/>Finally came the tight end decision. Jermichael Finley has been bad this season. Now, ESPN always has him ranked highly among the top TEs to start in any given week and overall (going in to week 12) he had the 5th most points among TEs. But this glosses over the fact that a third of his points for the entire season came in a 3 TD outburst against the Bears. He had 6 games catching 3 or fewer passes, and 4 games scoring 5 or fewer points. The other option was Fred Davis, whose production has closely tracked that of the Redskins QB situation. He has tended to do well with Rex Grossman. Davis has 6 games with 5 or more receptions, and 4 double-digit games total. I badly wanted to start him and felt the downside was limited but simply couldn&#8217;t pull the trigger. It&#8217;s really hard to bench someone when Aaron Rodgers is throwing the ball to them.<br/><br/>Given that my margin of defeat was so narrow, had I taken a different track on nearly any of them&#8230; well, it doesn&#8217;t bear thinking about. But I will anyway. Let&#8217;s go back to Thanksgiving day&#8230;<br/><br/>What a glorious day for football! For us on the West Coast, we were treated to a 9:30AM NFC North grudge match. My lineup was heavily front-loaded, with 4 of my 9 starters playing on Thanksgiving. In the Packers/Lions game I had Packers D/ST, Kevin Smith, and Jermichael Finley. My expectations were low for Finley, but I was hoping for 15+ from Smith. Things started out very promising in the early going, with Smith rushing 7 times for 36 yards and catching 3 passes for 21. But then he got hurt. And left the game. And didn&#8217;t return. And was stuck on 5 points. Finley was underwhelming as usual, catching two passes for 38 yards. Come on man, fight for those two extra yards and get me a tie! The Packer&#8217;s D/ST also had potential for a big game; Stafford had chucked 6 picks in his previous two games and did indeed throw 3 more against the Packers, but the unit only put up 8 fantasy points. Things did not look great coming out of this game (16 total points from 3 players), but the Dallas game was next&#8230;<br/><br/>Laurent Robinson did his thing, namely catch passes and get into the end zone. He finished up with 7 catches for 79 yards and the only 2 TDs Dallas scored in the narrow 20-19 win over Miami. Things were looking up. Plus, my opponent (ZM) hadÂ  picked up 14 from James Starks and Greg Jennings combined, which I counted as a win. Even though he hasn&#8217;t done it this season, Jennings has the potential to catch multiple touchdowns every time the Packers play. With no players in the Harbaugh Bowl for either of us, I sat back and waited for Sunday.<br/><br/>The Vikings/Falcons game was awesome and frustrating at the same time. ZM started Visanthe Shiancoe for some reason (I would have gone with Ballard, but he only got 4 anyway), and he was predictably unproductive. Meanwhile, Matt Ryan produced more of his Georgia Dome magic; he was 27-of-34 passing (79.4%) for 262 yards, 3 touchdowns and no turnovers (he fumbled once but Atlanta recovered). BUT, and there is a big but here: he targeted Julio Jones ZERO times. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Jets and Bills were having a shootout at the Meadowlands and Sanchez was ZM&#8217;s starting QB. I fully expected Sanchez to choke and put an end to the Jets&#8217; playoff hopes, which he very nearly did. Here is his stat line: 17-of-35 passing (48.6%) for 180 yards, 1 INT. Oh, and, for the first time in his career, 4 fucking TDs. He had 1 point more than Matt Ryan! Seriously, go back and look at Matty Ice&#8217;s stat line and tell me which one you would rather have. The guy averaging 5.1 yards an attempt or the guy averaging 7.7? The guy who threw a pick in a tie game that was promptly turned into a TD or the guy who stayed clean on turnovers? Fuck&#8217;s sake, I hate fantasy football sometimes.<br/><br/>In another early game, I had Steven Jackson going for the Rams while ZM had Beanie Wells going for the Cardinals. While I never root for a player to get hurt, in Beanie Wells&#8217; case it seems like a mathematical certainty that it has to happen at some point, and probably at many points. Unfortunately Sunday was not that day. While Jackson managed just 3.75 yards a carry, Wells exploded for 228 yards on 27 carries (8.44 ypc) and a TD for 28 fantasy points. Adding insult to injury, Patrick Peterson ran back yet another punt for TD giving ZM&#8217;s Cardials D/ST a boost. Fuckfuckfuck.<br/><br/>Things were looking dire by the time the late games started. But miraculously, the Raiders forgot how to score touchdowns for the first three quarters, and kicked six field goals instead! Kicker Sebastian Janikowski piled up 23 points, significantly more than any other player on my team besides Matt Ryan. Unfortunately I was keeping an eye on Fantasycast and noticed Marshawn Lynch&#8217;s numbers creeping steadily upward, topping out at 19 (24 carries, 111 rush yards; 1&#160;20 yard TD reception). That&#8217;s about the time that Ali started hiding the knives and any other household instruments of homicidal suicidal violence. Willis McGahee came through with 117 yards on the ground (but no TD), which helped blunt self-inflicted pain of sitting Marshawn. I lucked out in another one of the late games, as ZM&#8217;s star running back LeSean McCoy grabbed just 12 fantasy points (which is a win considering he has the most points among all RBs this year and averages 18 pts/game). <br/><br/>With neither of us having anyone going Sunday night, it all came down to Monday Night Football. I was up 6 (104-98) and ZM had Saints kicker John Kasay still to go. My narrow lead was (obviously) tenuous in the extreme. However, the Saints being the Saints, and the Giants being the Giants, I had a flicker of hope. The Giants defense has struggled lately, and if New Orleans could run them over and score touchdowns rather than kick field goals then I had a chance. Also available was the possibility of missed field goals, which give the kicker -1. However, just one long field goal would basically end it. This was, without a doubt, the most tense I have been while watching any football game in which I had zero interest as a fan. And it was a great game to watch, at least when the Saints were on the field. Brees did some amazing things, and was on target more or less all night. In one great play he shrugged off contact from two (three?) different pass rushers and delivered a completion while being dragged down. In another, near the goal line, he looked for his guys, found nobody, used his eyes to back off the linebackers and safety and tumbled (a bit awkwardly) in to the end zone. And yet every time the Saints faced a third down it was hair-raising. I was rooting for them to stay out of field goal range, but once they reached I had to immediately switch to praying for a touchdown rather than a stalled drive. (Remember, the kicker still gets 1 for each extra point)<br/><br/>The Saints started their first drive and moved to the Giants&#8217; 19 before stopping at 4th and 11, where they set up for a field gaol. This would have been a huge blow very early in the game, but wait! The holder tossed a short pass to Jimmy Graham, who was tackled two yards shy of the marker. The Giants took over, drove down the field, and set up in the red zone where Eli quickly threw an interception. Now it was the Saints turn again, and they promptly turned it in to 7. My lead inched down to 5. By the end of the 2nd quarter the Saints were up 21-3 and my lead was halved. I desperately hoped for New York to collapse in the second half and for the Saints to basically pack it in and stop scoring. On the other hand, this could mean they would reach field goal range and stall. Either way, all I could do was watch helplessly. The Saints scored touchdowns on each of their first two second half drives, bringing the score to 35-10. Drew Brees had now passed for 4 TDs and run for another. My lead was down to just 1.<br/><br/>It looked like the Giants were down for the count, that is until Victor Cruz scored a 72 yard touchdown. Then the Saints offense was on the field again. Gulp. The Saints started at their own 20 and gave the Giants a taste of the running game, which they handled as badly the air attack. During this drive the Saints ran 6 times and threw it 4, a big change up, and their backs looked gooood. Darren Sproles, Mark Ingram and Pierre Thomas were all involved, and the drive was helped by a personal foul against the Giants. Pierre Thomas ran it in from 12 yards out for the sixth New Orleans touchdown. After Kasay&#8217;s extra point, the matchup was tied. However, a tie would mean I still had a decent shot at a playoff spot. With Pat and Dave facing off that week, one would have to fall to 7-5. If I tied and moved to 5-5-2, I would be just one game behind the 7-5 team with two games to go, with a shot at the last wild card slot on the table (read the playoff rules in the settings area if you don&#8217;t know how it works). But a loss, and a 5-6-1 record meant that I would be 1.5 games behind the 7-5 team and would have lost my leading position as the 5th place team. (If the matchup had been tied, I would have also been tied in the standings with Ali for 5th). While 1.5 back with 2 games to go and 2 teams to jump isn&#8217;t impossible, it is obscenely improbable.<br/><br/>The Giants scored again with Cruz on the next drive, and the Saints ran it four times and turned it over on downs the next time they got the ball. The Giants advanced only five yards in four downs and turned it back over on downs. They fed it to Ingram three times in a row: first for no gain, then for 5 yards&#8230; Then, with just over a minute left in the game, Ingram took it for 35 yards and the TD&#8230;Â Â Â  <br/><br/>There is so much shoulda-coulda-woulda with a 1 point loss that it&#8217;s hard to add up. Shoulda played Fred Davis. Should NOT have played Julio. Should DEFINITELY have played Marshawn Lynch. Probably shoulda played Antonio Brown. Even coulda played Andre Johnson or Santana Moss (2 points each) over Julio and won, or even Nate fucking Burleson for that matter! But isn&#8217;t that why we love (and love to hate) fantasy football?<br/><br/>Kasay lined up for the extra point and, of course, made it.<br/><br/><strong>BREH 82 (8-4); WILL 77 (7-5)</strong><br/>This game had major playoff implications, with the winner clinching a spot and the loser now fighting for the last berth. Pat came out ahead in a game which was unimpressive on both sides. Welker had the 23 which propelled pat to victory. For Dave, Rodgers only threw 2 TD passe. However, if DeSean Jackson hadn&#8217;t rubbed canola oil all over his receiver gloves prior to the game, Dave would have won this won handily. (If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about, DeSean dropped like 4 long-ish passes including a TD.) Pat has clinched a playoff spot since he is 2 ahead of Ali (5th place) and owns the tiebreaker.<br/><br/><strong>HUH? 83 (6-6); MARC 61 (4-8)</strong><br/>Sucks when you leave big points on the bench, but if you look at it, the most Jordan could have gotten with any lineup 80, so I guess it&#8217;s not so bad. Another snoozer on both sides, except the mysterious breakout performance of DeAngelo Williams. Took some brass balls to start that sack of shit but it definitely paid off. Ali is chasing Dave for the fourth playoff spot.<br/><br/><strong>TWS 115 (11-1); MS 80 (4-8)</strong><br/>Don&#8217;t you fucking hate when a QB scores 26 fantasy points when his team got killed? Well that&#8217;s where Max is at. Oh also, Victor Cruz has firmly established himself as one of the three best free agent pickups of the season. AJ finally saw signs of life from Brandon Marshall, and Max&#8217;s running backs have cooled off a bit but this one was never even close. Plus, Arian Foster is likely to ramp back up as Houston looks to abandon the forward pass completely. Max is (obviously) in the driver&#8217;s seat heading into the playoffs but, hey, anything can happen right? I&#8217;d like to see him start Tebow and take it all the way.<br/><br/><strong>TUSK 124 (9-3); ZAK 93 (3-9)</strong><br/>Drew Brees is a dick, huh? Things were looking decent for Zak headed into MNF. Brady had a big week with 34, while MJD and Michael Bush put up 29 together. Reggie Wayne was on the bench with 18 but, so what? I mean, the Giants can <em>kind of</em> play defense, right? And Brees can&#8217;t <em>always</em> throw TDs to Jimmy Graham, especially now that other teams are in on the secret, right? Right? Nope. Brees went off to the tune of 44 (see stats mentioned in my pity-party above) and two of his TD passes were to Graham who finished with 20. Those two guys together put up 64 points, and Phil only got 60 from all his other guys combined. As <a href="http://losthatsportsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/cris-collinsworth.jpg">Cris Colinsworth</a> might say, &#8220;Jeeeeeesus.&#8221; Congrats on a playoff spot Phil, see ya this weekend bud!<br/><br/><strong>SPAU 99 (5-6-1); LINC 73 (4-8)</strong><br/>BOOOORING. Andre is still technically in the playoff hunt (he has the same record as me) but it&#8217;s basically done. And Jenny basically checked out around week 3. Look at her roster: she&#8217;s carrying 2 guys on IR, and started the Eagles defense going against New England. She also has Delone Carter. Andre&#8217;s team actually looked very strong this week, despite the Pittsburgh crater in the middle. I mean seriously, Mike Wallace and Rashard Mendenhall, two of the best at their positions, combining for 7? I suppose it&#8217;s better than the Eagles D/ST -4 point contribution for Jenny.</p>
