<p class="lede">A crash course in evaluating fantasy football trades.</p><!-- more -->
<p>Justin and Zak&#8217;s <a href="http://20-20hindsight.tumblr.com/2013/09/18/justin-looking-to-punt-on-second-down.html">initial trade</a> was quickly (and wisely) quashed by our members. They&#8217;ve proposed another somewhat less lopsided exchange. In this post I&#8217;m going to review and rebut Zak and Justin&#8217;s arguments as to why we should accept this specific trade, and then talk about fantasy football trade values more generally.</p>

<blockquote class="text-big">#1: If there&#8217;s no collusion, and both owners truly feel the trade will improve their team, you should stay out of it.</blockquote>
<p>Under normal circumstances this is a fine argument. On the other hand, does anybody feel like we should abolish the laws establishing an age of consent? Sure, both parties are agree, but it&#8217;s not clear that one of them meets the standard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent">informed consent</a>. Just to be clear about this, going forward I would propose that future additions to the league (if any) serve a one-year probationary period during which they can&#8217;t execute any trades. After all, we must protect our children from predators. And further, vetoes aren&#8217;t meant only to prevent collusion – it&#8217;s perfectly reasonable to use them on lopsided trades. <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/resources/help/faq?name=how-do-i-veto-or-protest-a-trade">ESPN states</a> that vetoes (emphasis mine) &#8220;allow leagues to decide <em>whether a trade is fair to both parties</em> and to prevent collusion.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="text-big">#2: Justin has so little depth that the only way he can reload is by dealing some studs.</blockquote>
<p>This is true. This is also why you don&#8217;t spend over a quarter (28.5% to be precise) of your draft picks on fucking defenses and quarterbacks. And he still has two quarterbacks and two defenses on his roster! If he really wants depth, he should try to deal Eli or Cam to someone with a terrible QB situation (ahem&#8230; ZM). He should be able to get a flex player better than Aaron Dobson or Robert Turbin. Bottom line is that we shouldn&#8217;t be shamed into accepting a bad trade because someone had a God-awful draft.</p>
<blockquote class="text-big">#3: It&#8217;s two guys for four guys! It can&#8217;t be lopsided!</blockquote>
<p>Because of roster spot scarcity, in reality all trades are x-for-x, and never x-for-y.</p>

<p>ESPN&#8217;s projections this week for guys Zak is giving up: </p>
<ul><li>Starks: 15</li>
  <li>Moreno: 15</li>
  <li>Edelman: 14&#160;</li>
  <li>Brown: 14</li>
</ul><p>ESPN&#8217;s projections this week for guys Justin is giving up:</p>
<ul><li>Martin: 9</li>
  <li>Decker: 4</li>
</ul><p>If Zak could hack into ESPN&#8217;s system and create vaguely plausible but utterly unlikely projections for each player to bolster his case, I don&#8217;t think he would have gone this far. I&#8217;m going to qualify my statement right here: anything can happen in football on a week to week basis; it&#8217;s possible these guys all hit their projections, yadda yadda yadda. But anybody who thinks these projections are <em>likely to happen</em> is crazy. These bonkers projections have clearly had anb impact on this trade.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a quick look at what&#8217;s going on with these players beyond just this week. Starks is an injury fill-in and according to reports Lacy will be back following the Packers&#8217; Week 4 bye. Denver has been using Moreno because he&#8217;s the best pass protector among their running backs. His two TDs last week were a fluke, it seems certain that Ball and Hillman will see the field more as they improve their blocking. Edelman is playing the role of Only Trusted Receiver, so he&#8217;s getting huge volume. Brady likes both Amendola and Gronk more though, pushing Edelman to third on the priority list sooner rather than later. Finally, Antionio Brown is a #1 receiver on the NFL. Unfortunately, his quarterback&#8217;s horrifically bad offensive line limits his upside, along with his chances to catch deep balls.</p>
<p>Ok, lets look at the other guys. Through two weeks Doug Martin led the NFL in carries (53) and was second in yards (209) behind only LeSean McCoy (237), who, if you remember, started the season with a 184-yard outburst against the Redskins. So what, exactly, is the problem? Well, there are two, and both are (probably) imaginary. One is that his yards per carry – 3.9 – is down significantly from a year ago, when he averaged 4.5 YPC. The other is that he hasn&#8217;t scored a touchdown. I think both of these are due to the fact that we are only <em>two games into the season</em>. Just to point out how little you know after two weeks, last season in Adrian Peterson&#8217;s first two games he ran 33 times for 144 yards, 4.3 YPC. He would finish the season with 348 carries for 2,097 yards – 6.0 YPC. This isn&#8217;t to compare Martin to Peterson, but to highlight how little the first two weeks show. Oh also, AP faced off against two of the worst defenses in the NFL in those two games, Indy and Jacksonville. But he scored two touchdowns in his first game so nobody talked about it! Look, Tampa Bay&#8217;s offensive line hasn&#8217;t been stellar so far, despite being ranked highly in the preseason. But with two-time All-Pro guard Carl Nicks likely returning this week, this is exactly the wrong time to sell on Martin. Now for Decker. Yes, there are a ton of mouths to feed in Denver. Yes, he&#8217;s been disappointing in fantasy. Through two weeks here are you point totals for Denver receivers</p>
<figure><ul><li>D. Thomas: 33FP</li>
    <li>J. Thomas: 33FP</li>
    <li>Welker: 24FP</li>
    <li>Caldwell: 11FP (who!?)</li>
    <li>Decker: 11FP</li>
  </ul></figure><figcaption>Peyton hates Decker!</figcaption><p>But lets look at targets and catches.</p>
<figure><ul><li>Decker: 20 TAR / 11 REC / 55%</li>
    <li>Welker: 19 TAR / 12 REC / 63%</li>
    <li>D. Thomas: 17 TAR / 10 REC / 58%</li>
    <li>J. Thomas: 16 TAR / 11 REC / 69%</li>
    <li>Caldwell: 2 TAR / 2 REC / 100%</li>
  </ul></figure><figcaption>But&#8230; he&#8217;s throwing him more balls than anyone else.</figcaption><p>Look, there are two problems with Decker. He&#8217;s already dropped an astounding four passes. That&#8217;s really bad considering he only had eight drops all of last season. That said, it&#8217;s almost certain this is small sample randomness. The other problem for Decker? No touchdowns – yet. He leads the team in targets and he&#8217;s tied for second in receptions. But Welker and Julius Thomas each have three touchdowns, Demariyus has two and even Caldwell has one. Decker has zero, but that will absolutely change soon. If Martin and Decker had two or three touchdowns between them we wouldn&#8217;t be having this conversation. It&#8217;s way too soon to deal two stud players just becuase they haven&#8217;t been able to get in the end zone after two weeks.</p>
<figure><img src="http://www.crushable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Homeland2.gif"/></figure><h3>Scaricty &amp; Trade Value</h3>
<p>Doug Martin led the NFL in carries through two weeks. Let me rephrase: Doug Martin led the NFL in carries through two weeks <em>and Justin is trying to trade him.</em> Ok yes, I said that already. I also mentioned that Carl Nicks is returning soon. Last year Martin was the third best back in fantasy, but he probably won&#8217;t be <em>quite</em> that good this year. I still think he&#8217;ll be very good, say maybe 1500 total yards (he had over 1900 last year) and 10 total touchdowns (12 last year). That would come out to just over 13 FP per week. The trade we&#8217;re looking at is interesting since it&#8217;s two running backs and two recievers for one running back and one receiver. I realize that it&#8217;s not two separate two-for-one trades, but looking at it like that makes sense for roster/positional value. Starks and Moreno will probably combine to exceed that 13 FP bench mark this week. After that, Moreno may get a touchdown here or there but I think Starks will be averaging 2 FP or fewer. My guess would be that there will be two to four weeks the rest of the season where this pair outscores Martin. If you add in who Justin is starting in that other roster spot, a replacement level position player, which would conservatively average 4 FP, this trade looks horrible.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a little more balanced on the receiver side. This should be obvious because Zak&#8217;s real target is Martin. Brown is the clear #1 in Pittsburgh, but it&#8217;s not clear how he&#8217;ll do without Mike Wallace distracting defenses. I&#8217;d say pencil him in somewhere around 7–10 FP/week. Edelman will be up and down, and I don&#8217;t really want to try to put a number on it. If Amendola goes down again then he&#8217;ll be a WR1. If Gronk and Amendola come back and start kicking ass, he&#8217;ll be an afterthought. That&#8217;s a risky proposition compared to the #2 receiver on what looks like the NFL&#8217;s strongest pass attack.</p>
<p>The point about Martin is more important; namely, that it&#8217;s almost impossible to make a fair trade for a top-10 running back without sending a blue chip player back. I mean, Martin is on the undroppable list for God&#8217;s sake, and two of the players Zak is sending were undrafted and are injury fill-ins! </p>
