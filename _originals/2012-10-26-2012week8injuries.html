<div class="perma-only">
<p>Before I start running through the injuries… how about that Thursday game?? My opponent this week, Hoop, had both starting running backs going and hit the jackpot. AP went for a respectable 15 FP, but Doug Martin was the big story. He racked up an incredible 32 points on 215 scrimmage yards and a pair of touchdowns. Fuck. Other storylines: Josh Freeman is improving, Christian Ponder is regressing, the Vikings defense is in a tailspin.</p>
<p>After the draft and near the beginning of the season we discussed making this a keeper league. I hadn’t thought carefully about it before and I don’t think this would be a good decision, at least for this year. If we want to do it starting next year, great, but I think it’s important to decide before the draft. Further, people have been making add/drop and trade decisions without keepers in mind. If you have an issue with this, let me know, but for now this will be a one-and-done year. Now, on to week 8 injuries!</p>

<h3>Injuries and Impact</h3>
<h5>Green Bay Receivers</h5>
<p>Things are a little more clear <strong>Greg Jennings</strong>’s groin injury – he’ll be out for a while. He’s undergoing abdominal surgery to repair a torn muscle in that area, near where it joins to the groin muscles. The team says they expect him to miss three weeks although this kind of operation is more likely to hold him out four to six weeks. If that’s accurate he’ll make it back near the last week of the regular fantasy season. Also, this quote from Jennings wasn’t exaclty encouraging “<em>Hopefully</em> I can return before the season ends.” Also, <strong>Jordy Nelson</strong> popped up on the injury report with a hamstring problem midweek. He won’t test it until at least Saturday and possibly just before the early Sunday game. Be very careful with this – most reports indicate a worse-than-even chance he’ll play. Finally, Jermichael Finley’s ailing shoulder will likely limit his effectiveness this week. I don’t know what is wrong with this guy but he seems to constantly stick his foot in his mouth. Here’s his quote ” “I’m getting a lot of out routes where they’re keeping me close to the [sideline] to protect it… After this game, if I don’t get pounded, it should be right again.” As they say, loose lips sink ships. So what does all this mean? Basically that <strong>Randall Cobb</strong> and <strong>James Jones</strong> instantly become must-play receivers.</p>

<h5>Rams Receivers</h5>
<p><strong>Chris Givens</strong> and <strong>Brandon Gibson</strong> have emerged as credible receivers over the past two weeks (read: since Danny Amendola’s injury). Gibson has been getting the volume – 12 catches on 16 targets over that period for 151 yards. Givens has been getting the deep ball. In the past two outings he has six catches for 158 yards. At least while the bye weeks continue either of these guys could be a serviceable fill-in option. While the outcomes have been the same so far I expect some divergence… Givens has the higher ceiling but Gibson will be more consistent. That’s all well and good but <strong>Danny Amendola</strong> just threw in a twist. While he was expected to miss a couple more weeks he’s already resumed practicing on a limited basis. In reality, it’s unlikely he’ll play this week against the Patriots at Wembley Field in London, and the Rams have a bye after that. Amendola could return after that, but temper your expectations. The Rams play the Niners twice in four weeks with matchups with the Jets and Cardinals in between. Obviously the Niners defense is great, but while the Jets and Cardinals are mediocre overall they have been very effective against #1 WRs. The most interesting part will be to see if and how the Rams use Givens and Gibson when Amendola is back. Stay tuned.</p>

<h5>Steelers Running Backs</h5>
<p>This situation is still unclear. Right now it looks like <strong>Jonathan Dwyer</strong> will start with <strong>Rashard Mendenhall</strong> working in for a few snaps. Obviously they want to get Mendenhall back to full strength and it seems unlikely they’ll push a full load on him (that is, if he plays at all). Backup <strong>Isaac Redman</strong> is still hurt and probably won’t be active this week. Proceed with caution on Dwyer; I definitely won’t be starting Mendy.</p>

<h5>Colts Running Backs</h5>
<p>Indy’s presumptive lead back, <strong>Donald Brown</strong>, who has missed two weeks following a knee scope, is back in full practice. No reports just yet on how he looks but this throws the <strong>Vick Ballard</strong> situation out of whack. Ballard has been decent in Brown’s absence. Many expect some kind of workload split between these two, which is really unfortunate because if either one got a full load against the Titans defense they could have a huge day.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE: Aaron Hernandez will be out vs. the Rams.</em></p>
<h3>Matchup Watch</h3>
<p><em>Matchup info for the worst defenses in the league.</em></p>
<p><em><br/></em></p>
<h5>Titans</h5>
<p>Tennessee is home against Indy this week. I mentioned the messy Colts RB situation above so temper your expectations there. Elsewhere, go wild. I’m extremely pleased with this matchup for my boy Reggie Wayne. The other receivers that will see decent action, Donnie Avery and T.Y. Hilton, could also be fill-ins if you are particularly thin due to bye. The Colts’ tight ends have been pretty quiet this season, and despite all the hype about Fleener’s chemistry with Luck he’s been the second option at TE after Dwayne Allen. Either of these guys, or both, could do well this week but don’t count on it.</p>
<h5>Saints</h5>
<p>The Saints travel to Mile High this week to face the Broncos in the first of two back-to-back primetime appearances. The Saints are a disaster everywhere on defense so go ahead and start any Denver guys you have. Peyton, Thomas, Decker, and McGahee all figure to have huge games. Frankly, you should probably start any Saints receivers too – as usual Brees will have to throw a ton to stay in this game. Like Titans-Bills last week, go wild.</p>
<h5>Redskins</h5>
<p>The Steelers visit Washington this weekend. They have a mess in the backfield and while Dwyer should run fine, I expect the damage to be largely done by Antonio Brown, Mike Wallace, and Heath Miller. If RG3 can keep the ‘Skins in this game, all the better. He may be able to do so as the Steelers haven’t been great in coverage this year although they have been great against #1 WRs. I’m not sure who that is in the absence of Pierre Garçon. Presumably it will be Santana Moss, but perhaps they stick Ike Taylor on Leonard Hankerson as he will be the deeper threat.</p>
<h5>Chiefs</h5>
<p>The Chiefs host the Raiders this weekend. Frankly, the Raiders are just outside the five worst defenses in the league so feel free to start Chiefs players as well, just remember, Brady Quinn is getting the start. As for the Raiders, ummm… who knows? They’re up and down, but the matchup should make you feel particularly good about Denarius Moore and Darren McFadden.</p>
<h5>Bills</h5>
<p>The Bills are on bye this week. Next week they go to Houston to get feasted on by the Texans.</p>
