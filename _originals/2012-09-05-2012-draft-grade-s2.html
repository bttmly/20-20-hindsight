<p><br/> For Part 2 I&#8217;m going to change up the style a little bit. I found writing in paragraph form kind of difficult so instead for each person I&#8217;m going to go over the first few picks since they are so crucial, then highlight a few later picks I liked and a few I didn&#8217;t.</p>

<h3>Ali</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1: Maurice Jones-Drew</strong><br/> I&#8217;m skeptical of this move for a few reasons. First, and yes this is anecdotal, but look at Chris Johnson&#8217;s 2011 season when he was coming off a holdout. He wasn&#8217;t in game shape for the first half of the season <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JohnCh04/gamelog//#49-56-sum:stats">and it showed</a>. Through eight games he carried 121 times for a measly 366 yards (3.02 YPA) and just two total touchdowns. Now, I do think MJD is more disciplined than CJ2K and should come back decently conditioned, but missing camp and preseason is not a recipe for success. Incidentally, Chris Johnson came off the board with the next pick, and I strongly believe he&#8217;ll have a better season than MJD. Johnson was clearly back in game shape by the second half of the season; over the final eight games he ran 141 times for 681 yards (4.83 YPA) and three scores along with 26 catches for 212 yards and another three scores. <br/><br/><strong>Round 2: Jamaal Charles</strong><br/> After getting burned by Charles last season Ali doubled down with his second pick. Charles suffered a season ending ACL tear in the Chiefs&#8217; season opener last year, creating a huge hole in Ali&#8217;s roster at RB1. However I do like this pick this year. Of all the players to go down with ACL tears last season Charles has had the most time to recover. On the other hand, Charles&#8217;s calling card has always been his elite speed and elusiveness and if he lost any of that with his knee injury he could have a disappointing season. But check this out: <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/fantasy/football/ffl/story?page=nfldk2k12_decisionschiefsRB">"His career 6.07 yards per carry is the most of any running back in history with at least his number of attempts (499); only two other players have an average greater than 5.25."</a> Six yards per carry! SIX! And if you&#8217;re concerned about Charles splitting time with newly-acquired bruiser Peyton Hillis, don&#8217;t be. In his monster 2010 season Charles piled up 1467 rushing yards on just 230 attempts for a ridiculous 6.4 YPC on the season, while teammate Thomas Jones got 245 carries of his own. <br/><br/><strong>Round 3: Victor Cruz</strong><br/> The knock on Victor Cruz is that he <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/fantasy/football/ffl/story?page=nfldk2k12controversial">won&#8217;t be able to repeat</a> the number of long touchdown catches he head last year and I&#8217;m inclined to agree. He had TD catches of 68, 72, 74, 74, and 99 yards last year on his way to smashing the Giants franchise record for season receiving yards. Five TD grabs of 65+ yards is just absurd for a receiver who frequently plays out of the slot. Max snagged A.J. Green with the next pick who I think is a much better pick. <br/><br/><strong>Round 4: Darren Sproles</strong><br/> Sproles was a revelation last season as a speedy pass-catching space player out of the backfield, turning in by far the best season of his career. The Saints kept his rushing load very light with just 87 carries on the year, but he took those touches for an astounding 603 yards (6.9 YPA). He also caught 86 of 111 targets (77% catch rate; best in league) for 710 yards. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll match those rate stats but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see his counting stats go up as the Saints notch up his usage. With two somewhat risky RBs taken in rounds 1 and 2, I like this pick a lot since Sproles should be a more than solid flex option who can easily fill in as RB2 on bye weeks (or, knock on wood, in case of injury). <br/><br/><strong>Round 5: Peyton Manning</strong><br/> Let&#8217;s not rehash the Peyton Manning situation. Suffice to say he could end up top five at his position, giving him first round value in our league, or be working for ESPN as an analyst this time next year. With exciting young receiving talents Demaryius Thomas and Eric Decker, and Indy teammate Jacob Tamme, he&#8217;s got the weapons. With the season finally starting we&#8217;ll all be able to see for ourselves if Peyton still has the zip and accuracy he&#8217;s known for, and also if he can stretch the field with the long ball. <br/><br/><strong>Later Rounds</strong><br/> Ali grabbed Vernon Davis in the sixth, which I think was a questionable move with Antonio Gates still on the board. While he&#8217;s an elite talent, he didn&#8217;t catch a ton of balls last year and the Niners brought in a crop of new receivers so I think his upside is limited. Next he grabbed Robert Meachem, another so-so move as the guy isn&#8217;t really a reliable WR2, although he could develop into one in San Diego. Given the Peyton situation I think it was smart to go with a backup QB in the eighth round and I like Cutler to have a strong year. Ryan Williams in the 10th was also a strong move, as he should see significant touches once Beanie Wells inevitably goes down with an injury. He reached for a defense in the 12th; by this point you should know my feelings about this. Mike Williams in the 13th was a nice upside pick, as was LeGarrette Blount in the next round. I think Blount will get more carries than many expect. Eddie Royal in the last round was kind of useless, as he&#8217;s the third receiver on a team that will focus on two tight end sets. Jon Baldwin, who was picked later in that round, would have been a better selection.<br/><br/>I do feel like he was chasing last season&#8217;s numbers with Cruz and Jones-Drew which is always questionable, and two of his other picks in the first five rounds both missed essentially the entire 2011 season. But if I had to settle on a theme for Ali&#8217;s draft it would probably be &#8220;Go Big or Go Home&#8221; and I can respect that. After all, the goal is to win championships not just finish above .500.</p>
<h4>FINAL GRADE: B (83%)</h4>
<h3>Zak</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1: Drew Brees</strong><br/> Not much to say about this pick. Brees is obviously money in the bank, especially racking up six points per passing TD. In 2011 he led the league in passing scores (46), passing yards (5,476; NFL record), and completion percentage (71.2%; NFL record). Expect him to dominate again this year, although those 2011 numbers are so staggering it will be near impossible for him to repeat that performance.<br/><br/><strong>Round 2: Wes Welker</strong><br/> Welker was the second-most targeted player in the league last season and he reeled in 122 of the 172 balls thrown his way (71%). He&#8217;s one of the most consistent options at WR which is especially attractive given the boom/bust production of even the best receivers. He may see his targets notch downwards this season but I think this is a solid pick. The only worry is if he develops DeSean Jackson Syndrome from his failure to secure a long term deal from the Patriots, even while they were busy <a href="http://espn.go.com/boston/nfl/story/_/id/8306183/new-england-patriots-tight-end-aaron-hernandez-agree-extension-sources-say">locking up Aaron Hernandez for $40 million</a>. But Welker will still take home $9.5 million from his franchise tender, and he doesn&#8217;t seem to have a petulant streak so it should be smooth sailing. <br/><br/><strong>Round 3: Michael Turner</strong><br/> Turner has been remarkably consistent for years, but he&#8217;s getting older and his production will tumble sooner or later. He&#8217;s 31 this season and has carried a heavy load for the past few years. You can&#8217;t defy <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/articles/age.htm">father time</a> forever. Further, the Falcons are expected to run an up tempo pass-first offense and Turner has terrible hands; I&#8217;d expect them to ratchet up Jacquizz Rodgers&#8217;s workload over the course of the season. Turner could have one more solid season left in him but I kind of doubt it. <br/><br/><strong>Round 4: Dez Bryant</strong><br/> It&#8217;s always frustrating to see a special talent screwing around off the field. And by &#8220;screwing around&#8221; I mean doing things like <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2012/07/dez-bryant-arrested-on-domestic-violence-chrage/1#.UEeO1VT0DrM">assaulting his own mother</a>. The Cowboys have set up <a href="http://espn.go.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/8304196/dez-bryant-dallas-cowboys-adhere-strict-team-mandated-guidelines-behavior">some rules</a> to try to keep Bryant on the straight and narrow, including a ban on alcohol and strip clubs. We&#8217;ll see if that works, but it seems like the Cowboys left a pretty big loophole here. After all, <a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/">you don&#8217;t have to go to a titty bar to see strippers</a>. I think there were better talents on the board when Zak grabbed Bryant, notably Antonio Brown who went to Hooper two picks later. <br/><br/><strong>Round 5: Demaryius Thomas</strong><br/> Going into the fifth round with one running back on your roster is bad; leaving the fifth with just one is even worse. While Thomas could evolve into a deadly outside threat this season (he had a bonkers 17.2 YPC last season) he is still very raw. According to profootballfocus.com, he dropped 13.5% of his catchable balls (15th highest drop rate in the league), and taking him 17th among wideouts seems too high for a guy who still needs so much development. <br/><br/><strong>Round 6: Kevin Smith</strong><br/> I like Kevin Smith, but not as an RB2. When healthy he&#8217;s a great flex option but relying on him all year seems like a stretch given his injury history. On the other hand, Jahvid Best may not play at all this year (or ever again, yikes) and Mikel Leshore will be suspended so Smith will have plenty of time to establish himself in the Lions offense. If he plays 13 or 14 games this year he&#8217;s an absolute steal in the 6th round but I think that&#8217;s a long shot. A<br/><br/><strong>Later Rounds</strong><br/> Zak snagged DeSean Jackson in the seventh which I think is a phenomenal pick; if I had to put money down I&#8217;d bet Jackson will outscore Demaryius Thomas and Dez Bryant this year. Still, RB depth is critically important especially with aging or injury prone guys like Turner and Smith as starters, and Zak has basically none. He waited until the <em>13th round</em> to add a third running back! His intervening picks included Lance Moore (ehh…), Jared Cook (nice upside), Laurent Robinson (eww), a defense (God. Damn. It.), and Mr. Mediocre himself – Nate Fucking Burleson. He missed a number of backup running backs who will likely see significant carries at some point this season including David Wilson, CJ Spiller, Ryan Williams and Jacquizz Rodgers. He finally snagged Jonathan Dwyer in the 13th, which could end up paying off as Isaac Redman is currently hurt and Mendenhall isn&#8217;t ready to return just yet. After a kicker in the 14th (thumbs down) he finally grabbed a fourth running back in the 15th – Rashad Jennings. While Jennings will start the season for the Jags, MJD is back and he&#8217;ll carry the load even if he has a slow start.<br/><br/>Zak&#8217;s lack of options at running back is a glaring flaw, however if things shake out right he could do fine. First, hitching your wagon to Drew Brees is a recipe for success in this league. Second, he&#8217;s got four potentially elite receivers and if they all pan out he should be able to flip one for a solid RB. Third, if Jared Cook has the breakout year that many are expecting then the load on the so-so running backs will be lightened considerably.</p>
<h4>FINAL GRADE: B- (82%)</h4>
<h3>Philly D</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1: Tom Brady</strong><br/> I discussed this pick and why I like it in Part 1. Brady&#8217;s incredibly consistent, extremely accurate, and has the best weapons in the league. I do think those <a href="http://articles.boston.com/2012-08-17/names/33231016_1_tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-dog-collar">bizarre dog collar ads</a> were a mistake though. <br/><br/><strong>Round 2: Greg Jennings</strong><br/> Greg Jennings is fucking cool as shit. Every time I see him interviewed he seems like just about the nicest, most affable guy on the planet. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1P0yfq2wDvU%0D%0A">Plus, he&#8217;s been known to put the team on his back &#8216;do</a>. I think he&#8217;ll have a very nice year, especially as defenses are forced to give Jordy Nelson a lot of attention. Unlike the other teams with elite quarterbacks (New England, New Orleans), the Packers don&#8217;t have zillion great receiving targets. Jermichael Finley has the tools but not the hands and Cedric Benson won&#8217;t be catching a lot of passes. Some combination of Donald Driver/Randall Cobb/James Jones will work in at WR3 but Jennings and Nelson will be a deadly WR1-WR2 combo and I expect Jennings to have the better year this time around.<br/><br/><strong>Round 3: Steven Jackson</strong><br/> Jackson&#8217;s numbers from last year are surprisingly decent (1478 yards from scrimmage, 6 total touchdowns), but he&#8217;s clearly on the down slope with his rushing yards declining each of the past two years. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if he finished sub-1000 yards rushing for the first time since his rookie year. The Rams ratcheted down his carry load substantially last year (330 in 2010, 260 in 2011); he&#8217;ll probably have a similar number this year and a 29 year old running back looking at 260-ish carries isn&#8217;t what you want in an RB1. <br/><br/><strong>Round 4: Stevie Johnson</strong><br/> Reaching for Johnson here was a bad move since there was better talent on the board at that position (Antonio Brown and Steve Smith for example). He also could have looked to grab a second running back (Doug Martin was available) rather than going for a deeper position like receiver. But Johnson has shown flashes of brilliance and if Fitzpatrick&#8217;s true talent level is closer to his production in the first half of 2011 rather than the second half Stevie could put up excellent numbers.<br/><br/><strong>Round 5: 49ers D/ST</strong><br/> Taking defenses early is dumb. The year-to-year consistency in fantasy production is almost nil. In the specific case of the Niners Defense there are a number of reasons why they shouldn&#8217;t have been first off the board. First, chasing last year&#8217;s stats is a bad idea. Second, the Niners defense miraculously avoided injuries last year, something they&#8217;re unlikely to repeat this year. Third, they&#8217;re playing all the best offenses in the NFL this year including games against each of the quarterbacks to reach 5,000 yards passing in 2011 and Eli Manning who was just a hair shy of that mark. Sure, they still get to beat up on the putrid offenses of the weakest division in the league but taking them in the fifth round was still the biggest reach of the draft. <br/><br/><strong>Round 6: Mark Ingram</strong><br/> The Saints backfield is among the most frustrating for fantasy owners. They throw the ball at a high rate and when they do run it it&#8217;s hard to tell who will carry the load. Still, they spent a high pick on Ingram in the 2011 so I expect the carry split to tilt more towards him in his sophomore season. Some also expect the Saints offense to be a little more conservative in their play calling in the absence of Sean Payton which would mean more work for Ingram. On the other hand, Ingram wasn&#8217;t exactly electrifying last year with just 474 yards on 122 carries (3.9 YPA). <br/><br/><strong>Later Rounds</strong><br/>Taking Hernandez in the seventh was a smart pick; as I mentioned before I think he&#8217;ll have a great year. Anquan Boldin in the eighth round? Not so much. He&#8217;ll be 32 this year and his reception total has decreased each of the past three seasons. Torrey Smith is the preferred passing option in Baltimore now and this pick would have been better spent on a player with more upside e.g. Nate Washington. Andrew Luck as a backup was a nice add in the ninth, as the Indy offense seems to be coming together quicker than anyone expected. Phil reached all the way into the 10th round for Niners kicker David Akers&#8230; again: stupid. He spent the rest of the draft snagging players I can&#8217;t imagine starting at any point this season barring a miracle (or catastrophe): Mike Tolbert, Leonard Hankerson, Brandon Jacobs, Dustin Keller, and Taiwan Jones. Actually, Taiwan Jones is apparently second on the Raiders RB depth chart so he could definitely see action at some point. Oh, and Phil also picked up a backup kicker in the 15th. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m not giving this draft a C.</p>
<h4>FINAL GRADE: B- (81%)</h4>
<h3>Max</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1: Chris Johnson</strong><br/> I&#8217;ll say it right now: I think Chris Johnson will finish top-three among running backs this year. Despite his rough start last year after ending his holdout he put up solid numbers in the second half of the season. He&#8217;s back this year with a full training camp and preseason under his belt ready to reclaim his throne. With the Eagles signaling they&#8217;ll reduce LeSean McCoy&#8217;s workload this year it seems like a top-three spot should be within his grasp. Plus, the Titans under Jake Locker will stretch the field more than they have in the past allowing Johnson some space to run. This was a very solid pick, and quite lucky too as Ali opted for the risky Maurice Jones-Drew one pick earlier.<br/><br/><strong>Round 2: Matt Forte</strong><br/> Another very nice pick. Fantasy people seem to be divided into two camps on Forte. Some think the presence of Michael Bush will cause his numbers to take a tumble and some don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m inclined to agree with the second group. I expect the Bears&#8217; passing offense to take a big step forward this season with the additions of Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery at receiver, which will also help open up running lanes for backs. While Bush should see some carries, this offense ran through Forte last season (he was their leading rusher and receiver) and I think he&#8217;ll put up nice numbers this season as well. <br/><br/><strong>Round 3: A.J. Green</strong><br/> A.J. Green is a stud and showed big time chemistry with Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton last season. However I think both he and his QB take a step back this year after surprisingly effective rookie seasons. The Bengals are in a tough division and while I like A.J. Green I doubt he&#8217;ll match his 2011 numbers or place among the top 10 at his position (he was taken eighth among WRs).<br/><br/><strong>Round 4: Brandon Marshall</strong><br/> I&#8217;ve mentioned it earlier but I&#8217;ll say it again - I think the Bears offense will be pretty damn good this year <em>as long as Jay Cutler can stay upright behind a highly questionable line</em>. Marshall and Cutler have chemistry from their Denver days when each posted the best season of his career to date. Marshall should do well this year and I like this pick in the fourth round.<br/><br/><strong>Round 5: Phillip Rivers</strong><br/> Max was cruising through the draft going into the fifth round with two excellent RBs and a pair of solid receivers, and picked the right time to go after a quarterback. Four of the twelve fifth round picks were signal callers and Max ended that run with Phillip Rivers, another quality pick. After a tough 2011 campaign I think Rivers will come back strong in 2012. As I mentioned in the quarterback tiers post, Rivers has denied playing injured last year though many doubt this claim. Meanwhile his go-to guy Antonio Gates was hobbled by turf toe essentially all year. Though the Chargers lost V-Jax in free agency to the Bucs, Rivers&#8217;s fantasy track record points to a return to form.<br/><br/><strong>Round 6: Reggie Bush</strong><br/> Seemingly out of nowhere Reggie Bush put together a compelling 2011 campaign and he&#8217;s gone on record saying his goal is to win the rushing title this year. On the other hand, the Dolphins drafted Daniel Thomas in the second round in 2011 and he was the presumptive starter heading into last season. He injured a hamstring early in the season and Bush poached his job, but if Bush struggles this year the tables could easily turn. Overall this is probably a solid pick for the flex spot given how thin the RB position was by the sixth round.<br/><br/><strong>Later Rounds</strong><br/> After six picks I more or less agreed with you might be wondering why I have Max&#8217;s draft graded so low. Well, clogging four of your seven bench spots with backup tight ends and quarterbacks isn&#8217;t a good draft strategy. He drafted just four running backs and four receivers in the entire draft; in comparison most people have about 11 players at those two positions combined. This means his team is exceptionally vulnerable to injury or simply a drop off in performance by one of his core RBs/WRs. He snagged Pierre Garcon in the seventh, which I think is an OK pick at that spot since Garcon has reportedly been working mostly on the outside as RGIII&#8217;s down field threat. But he feels like one of those torturous receivers who goes for 20+ then follows it with three straight goose eggs. Garcon was followed by Michael Bush in the eighth who is a wait-and-see guy while Chicago&#8217;s offensive scheme becomes more clear. After that things fell entirely apart. Max had no idea Jason Witten has a lacerated spleen and took him in the ninth, followed by Alex Smith in the 10th, Greg Olsen in the 11th and another quarterback, Ryan Fitzpatrick, in the 12th. So over four picks he snagged two tight ends and two quarterbacks while guys like CJ Spiller, Toby Gerhart, Jacquizz Rodgers, and Alshon Jeffery came off the board. Yikes. In the 13th he went with super long-shot David Nelson (who I had mentioned to him before his work league draft) followed by yet another tight end in Coby Fleener in the 14th. <br/><br/> Max&#8217;s team could still be pretty good if his guys avoid injuries, but when bye weeks start he&#8217;ll have some tough match ups. If two of his tight ends turn out to be starting quality he&#8217;ll be able to put one in the flex to ease the load on his RBs and WRs, but unless he starts adding free agent talent soon he&#8217;ll end up in a tough spot at some point.</p>
