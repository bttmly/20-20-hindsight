<p>- The back spasms that ailed <strong>Marshawn Lynch</strong> last season are already acting up; he&#8217;s questionable for week 1.</p>
<p>- If <strong>Jonathan Stewart</strong> ends up sitting <strong>DeAngelo Williams</strong> should see a very nice number of carries.</p>
<p>- Obviously Green Bay brought in <strong>Cedric Benson</strong> to be their lead back, but with <strong>James Starks</strong> ruled out it&#8217;s possible the Pack take this opportunity to give <strong>Alex Green</strong> a few touches to see how his reconstructed knee is doing.</p>
<p>- <strong>Arian Foster</strong> apparently has some kind of knee thing; the word is the Texans are just being cautious. I really hope so.</p>
<p>- Seems like the Steelers and Vikings (<strong>Mendenhall</strong> and <strong>Peterson</strong> respectively) are keeping their star running backs questionable to force defenses to account for them. Neither is likely to see many carries this week, but Peterson might be ready for a moderate load by week 2. The outlook for Mendenhall is probably late-September.</p>
<p>- Second string Patriots RB <strong>Shane Vereen</strong> may miss this week, potentially allowing <strong>Stevan Ridley</strong> to put a stranglehold on his starting spot. Still&#8230; who knows?</p>
<p>- Receivers <strong>Marques Colston</strong> (NO), <strong>Denarius Moore</strong> (OAK), and <strong>Stevie Johnson</strong> (BUF) are all listed as questionable. Keep an eye on them.</p>
