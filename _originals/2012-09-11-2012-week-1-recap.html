<p>While the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000061073/article/nfl-power-rankings-robert-griffin-iiiled-redskins-shoot-up?module=HP11_cp">Niners upset win at Lambeau</a> was undoubtedly the biggest <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=irl">IRL</a> story from week one, this is all about fantasy football so my boy Matty Ice gets the top spot. Matt Ryan lead all fantasy players in week one with 37 points (in our settings), accounting for four touchdowns (three pass, one rush) and going 23-31 passing for 299 yards. He also tacked on 25 yards rushing. The Falcons&#8217; big opener against the Chiefs will be discussed a little later on.</p>

<p>Anyone interested in making some trades this season please take a sec to go the trading block page on ESPN (it&#8217;s under the My Team tab). There&#8217;s been an absurdly small number of trades over the past two years - using the trading block should help people see who&#8217;s available and encourage a little more wheeling and dealing. Do it. Here we go with the week one recaps.</p>
<h3>Nick v. Pat</h3>
<p><em>Charlie&#8217;s $150 Dick Rash v. Town Taxes</em></p>
<p>This matchup didn&#8217;t start off particularly well for me, with Romo putting up a big 28 points in the Cowboys&#8217; upset win over the defending champs. My last minute add of Martellus Bennett at tight end did work out though; he had 40 yards and a touchdown for 10 points. My team gathered steam on Sunday when Matt Ryan connected with Julio Jones for two scores (59 points combined). But the Falcons game was a nailbiter since Pat was starting Ryan&#8217;s other two favorite targets, Roddy White and Tony Gonzalez. Last year Gonzalez and White caught 15 touchdowns combined from Matt Ryan, more than half of his season total. Jones snagged eight. So any touchdown to any of those three would be either a big boom or huge bust: double points from one to Jones, but likely negative relative points from one to Gonzalez or White (passing and receiving cancel each other out, receivers get more points per yard). I lucked out with Jones grabbing two scores, Gonzalez snagging one and zero for White, while Matt Ryan ran another in himself. Meanwhile Arian Foster scored two touchdowns of his own, although he didn&#8217;t run the ball particularly efficiently. Pat found big points from the Jets defense, which absolutely hammered the Bills for three quarters before surrendering two touchdowns in the final 15 minutes, topping out at 29 fantasy points before finshing at 21. Pat elected to start Cedric Benson over Marshawn Lynch due to reports Lynch was suffering back spasms. Benson has never been a particularly explosive runner (3.7 career YPC) and he couldn&#8217;t get anything going against the stout Niners run defense. Also painful was Shanahan&#8217;s last minute decision to start Alfred Morris over Roy Helu; Morris had been the presumptive third stringer. My nasty surprise was Adrian Peterson coming back at what looked like 100% and leaving Gerhart, who many saw having a huge week, with just one fantasy point. Still, the strong outings by Ryan, Jones and Foster clinched this before Monday night came around.</p>
<p><em>Nick 109 (1-0); Pat 92 (0-1)</em></p>
<h3>Max v. ZM</h3>
<p><em>Fuck You Aaron Sorkin v. Orange County Gunners</em></p>
<p>Same shit, different day, huh? After week one Max&#8217;s team already looks like a potential juggernaut - shades of last season. Before the games counted a bunch of analaysts predicted the Bears might make some noise in the NFC North this season. I was skeptical. I mean, after all, the Packers went 15-1 last year and the Stafford / Megatron chemistry looked like the best we&#8217;ve seen in years, plus Stafford threw it for over 5,000 yards in his first complete season. Anyway Max went all in on the Bears offense in the draft, grabbing Matt Forte, Michael Bush, and Brandon Marshall. Admittedly it&#8217;s only been a week, and they played Indy, but that trio posted 51 fantasy points. The Bears will get four games against the Lions and Packers to show what they&#8217;re made of, but they look dangerous right now. The Packers offense failed to click as they lost to the Niners at Lambeau and the Lions needed 59 minutes to put away the dismal Rams (2-14 last season). Anyway, Max had some monster performers sitting on the bench but he still won the match-up handily. The big disappointment for ZM was Carolina&#8217;s impotent running game as he started both Cam Newton and DeAngelo Williams. With Jonathan Stewart out, DeAngelo Williams seemed primed for a bushel of carries and a big game. But he carried just six times for a dismal -1 yard while Cam only managed four yards on five totes. While Newton threw for over 300 yards his two picks essentially negated his touchdown throw to Brandon LaFell leaving him with just 12 points. Andre Johnson had a monster game (17 points) but Mike Wallace (9) and Vincent Jackson (4) were underwhelming. This matchup was never that close, with Matt Forte (18) and Brandon Marshall (17) doing the heavy lifting. Despite Chris Johnson&#8217;s paltry four points Max won this one easily and at this extremely early stage looks like a dangerous playoff contender.</p>
<p><strong>Max 94 (1-0); ZM 78 (0-1)</strong></p>
<h3>Ali v. Phil</h3>
<p><em>Chomo Se Dice: Bolsa De Bolsas v. The Bauce of Sauce</em></p>
<p>Both Ali and Phil had some surprisingly weak performances from key players. Steven Jackson, Greg Jennings, Jamaal Charles, and Victor Cruz, all of whom were throught to be integeral to their teams&#8217; game plans, all posted single digits. Ali was in the awkward position of his quarterback facing off against his defense; while Peyton had a very nice premiere with the Broncos that bodes well for the rest of Ali&#8217;s season he did pick apart the Steelers defense. LeGarrette Blount, widely expected to share carries with Doug Martin at least in the first few games posted a goose egg (I may have suggested he start Blount&#8230; sorry &#8216;bout it). There were really no huge surprising performances here and I don&#8217;t have too much to say about it. Here&#8217;s a little pep talk for Ali though: MJD is back, Jay Cutler and the Chicago offense look terrifying, and Cruz and Charles will improve.</p>
<p><strong>Ali 69 (0-1); Phil 88 (1-0)</strong></p>
<h3>AJ v. Jenny</h3>
<p><em>No Work Today v. Team Linchey</em></p>
<p>Jenny&#8230; pleeease pick a team name. C&#8217;mon. Please? Holy hell, Jenny&#8217;s squad was on fire this week. One thing that makes her scores so striking is that seven of her nine starters posted double digits. However, every player on her team besides Marques Colston and kicker Mason Crosby scored a touchdown (including the Ravens defense). That&#8217;s not going to happen every week. But while I think Shonn Greene in particular over-achieved in week one, Colston clearly is worth more than four points a week. Her Achilles heel, if she has one, is running back depth; her two bench backs combined for two points. As for AJ&#8230; ouch. Fred Jackson went down with an LCL sprain and will miss some significant time. Some sources say three weeks, some say a month at the very least and likely longer. The Bills utter defensive collapse against the Jets added insult to injury as they sapped -6 points from AJ&#8217;s score. There is a silver lining for AJ though. First, Alshon Jeffery was excellent in his pro debut and should thrive playing opposite Brandon Marshall. Second, BenJarvus Green-Ellis ran far better than many expected; his <a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/auto/0ap1000000060554/Green-Ellis-6-yard-TD">touchdown run in particular was awesome</a>. Fourth, later round bench guys are already getting snaps and touches which bodes well for them as the season progresses (Jacquizz Rodgers, Danny Amendola). Finally, Joe Flacco. The Ravens offense looked completely different from the earlier years of Flacco&#8217;s tenure. Tight end Dennis Pitta was a matchup nightmare, Torrey Smith stretched the field and Anquan Boldin made some amazing grabs (<a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/auto/0ap2000000060167/Flacco-to-Boldin-for-34-yard-TD">this</a>) all while Flacco was masterfully orchestrating a no-huddle offense. Where the hell did this come from? Given how much the Texans run it, AJ may have to start Flacco over Schaub sooner rather than later. One troublesome stat though: Jermichael Finley already has two drops after week one, a problem that plagued him last year. I can&#8217;t imagine a guy like Aaron Rodgers has much patience for this.</p>
<p><strong>AJ 77 (0-1); Jenny 116 (1-0)</strong></p>
<h3>Dave v. Hoop</h3>
<p><em>That&#8217;s No Moon v. Woodgrain Chestnut</em></p>
<p>This was a tough loss for Dave. Stafford had a surprisingly bad game agasint a Rams defense that allowed an average of 25.4 points last season on the way to a 2-14 record while playing six games against the impotent offenses of the 2011 NFC West. The Lions offense averaged nearly 30 points a game last year. Stafford&#8217;s three picks crushed his point total and he finished with just 11. Meanwhile RG3 was on the bench, lighting up the Saints to the tune of 28 fantasy points. Hoop got by Dave this week in part thanks to the dominant Texans defense which hammered the Miami offense and picked off rookie quarterback Ryan Tannehill three times in his pro debut. AP shocked the football world by carrying the load for the Vikings in week one and banging out 20 fantasy points, and while Hoop had him benched in week one he already looks like a steal in the draft. Hoop appeared initially to have some running back depth concerns but with AP back and Doug Martin already taking the bulk of the carries he should be fine, especially if David Wilson can stop <a href="http://www.newsday.com/sports/football/giants/giants-rookie-david-wilson-denies-crying-after-fumble-1.3960726">fumbling and crying</a>, although how long he&#8217;ll be in the doghouse is anyone&#8217;s guess. If I had to make a call now, I&#8217;d say both Hoop and Dave are playoff contenders. If RG3 continues to impress and Stafford stumbles against a cupcake matchup Dave&#8217;s lineup choices will become incredibly difficult. Stevan Ridley&#8217;s 152 yards from scrimmage plus a touchdown is the big bright spot for Dave; if Ridley consistently gets 17-20 carries it will dramatically improve Dave&#8217;s team. Larry Fitz, Jordy Nelson and Antonio Gates should all improve going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Dave 91 (0-1); Hooper 98 (1-0)</strong></p>
<h3>Zak v. Brian</h3>
<p><em>Es Over As: Not Brian&#8217;s Team v. We Got Nicks Like Jesus</em></p>
<p>This was a brutal loss for Brian, who had a good chance to knock off Zak. With dismal performances from Michael Turner (3) and Wes Welker (1) Zak was extremely vulnerable going into Monday night. While he did get big production from Kevin Smith and Demaryius Thomas, the bulk of Zak&#8217;s roster underperformed dramatically. On the other side of the matchup, Ahmad Bradshaw had a pleasant 14-point outing for Brian in the Wednesday season opener but Hakeem Nicks posted just three. Zak&#8217;s guys were boom/bust throughout the weekend, with just the previously mentioned Smith and Thomas, plus Drew Brees, posting double digits, but he was still able to take a 25-point lead into Monday night. That lead would have been 22 had Roethlisberger not thrown a game-sealing pick six to Ed Reed toward the end of the Sunday night game. Brian&#8217;s team is stocked with Raiders and he had three potentially big scorers set to go in the final game of week one. Janikowski&#8217;s ridiculous boot makes him a threat for double digits every week (he hit a 51-yard field goal on Monday night), Darrius Heyward-Bey is a downfield threat with elite speed, and a healthy Darren McFadden is arguably the league&#8217;s most devastating runner. Unfortunately for Brian this trio came up two points short, despite McFadden&#8217;s absurd <em>thirteen</em> receptions. This is a tough loss to swallow for Brian, but his team looks far better than I expected. Frank Gore is running with speed and agility <em>(Update: Brian later traded Gore to Hooper)</em> after seeming to wear down significantly near the end of last season, and with Fred Jackson out for a while CJ Spiller could carve out a nice role for himself in Buffalo. He averaged over <em>twelve</em> yards per carry on Sunday agasint the Jets defense which was seventh in YPA last year. He&#8217;s also still carrying three quarterbacks and so can easily drop one and grab a free agent flyer to help bolster his receiving corps. On Zak&#8217;s side, while it&#8217;s always tough to tell with the Saints, first impressions indicate Lance Moore is the favored downfield threat with Robert Meachem out of the picture. If he can establish himself in this role he could be a goldmine.</p>
<p><strong>Zak 94 (1-0); Brian 92 (0-1)</strong></p>
