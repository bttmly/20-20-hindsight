<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.7718683268749512">With  week 3 now in the books, seven of our twelve teams are sitting on a 1-2  record and three more undefeated at 3-0. This week also saw three games  decided by two or fewer points, all of which came down to Monday Night  Football. The other three were blowouts of greater or lesser magnitudes.  The point differentials were 28, 44 and <strong>82</strong>. Damn.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>BREH (2-1) v. LINC (1-2)</span></strong><br/><span>When  a team with Michael Vick on the roster breaks through 130 points, you  would assume the star Eagles quarterback had something to do with it.  Perhaps 3 passing TDs and a pair on the ground? Nope. In fact Vick left  the game early with a hand injury. His final stat line? 176 yds passing,  31 yds rushing, one pick, three fumbles and zero touchdowns. The Eagles  were able to recover all three of those fumbles so Vick wasn&#8217;t docked  for them. However, this is Vick&#8217;s second straight week with a pick and  three fumbles. Anyway, long story short, Pat (BREH) hung 132 on Jenny  (LINC) with minimal help from Vick. Welker led the way with 34 (217 yds,  2 TD) and was helped out by Rob Gronkowski&#8217;s two touchdown catches.  Welker and Gronkowski caught all four of Tom Brady&#8217;s TD lobs in week 3.  Megatron (22) and Ahmad Bradshaw (19) also put up good numbers. Jenny  didn&#8217;t have the firepower to answer back: Schaub (30) tagged the New  Orleans secondary for 3 touchdowns and 373 yards, and she got decent  performances from Willis McGahee and Roddy White, but the rest of her  roster was in single digits. Pat&#8217;s squad is the only team at 2-1.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>TWS (3-0) v. DEM (1-2)</span></strong><br/><span>Max  (TWS, 3-0) stays perfect with a 2 point win over me (DEM, 1-2) in a  matchup that came down to Monday Night Football. Going into MNF the  score was 73-82, with Santana Moss left to play for me. Moss grabbed 5  balls for 70 yards; not quite enough to get the job done.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>TUSK (3-0) v. MARC (0-3)</span></strong><br/><span>Philly  D (TUSK) put up a staggering 133 in a match that was never even close.  Leading the charge were Brees (32) and LT (20), along with Ray Rice  (16). Jordan (MARC) is the only remaining winless team, after stunningly  bad performances from some of the year&#8217;s top scorers. Philip Rivers had  three turnovers and no TDs, netting 6 points (after 21 and 22 in weeks 1  and 2 respectively). The Law Firm had a measly 1 point, as did Steve  Smith, who averaged 21 over the first two weeks. His only two  double-digit scorers were AP and Larry Fitzgerald, neither of whom broke  15.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>WILL (3-0) v. SPAU (1-2)</span></strong><br/><span>In  another close match, Dave edged out Andre to keep his record spotless.  Going into MNF, the score was tied. Dave&#8217;s only player was Fred Davis,  who ended up with a single catch for 23 yards, winning the game for  WILL. Both QBs in this matchup (Stafford and Rodgers) put up 27. Other  stars were Ryan Matthews (WILL; 26) and Mike Wallace (SPAU; 20).</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>ZAK (1-2) v. HUH? (1-2)</span></strong><br/><span>Ali  (HUH?) and Zak (ZAK) had the third close game, which came down to Tim  Hightower&#8217;s production against Dallas on MNF. Hightower was ultimately  one point short, however HUH? also suffered from a pair of goose eggs  laid by the Jets D/ST and, surprisingly, Deion Branch. Team Welsh (great  name by the way) was led, as usual, by Tom Brady (31). So far this  season Brady has provided just over 35% of Zak&#8217;s total points. Ali got  solid performances from all three of his running backs, but the poor  play of his WRs handed him to the narrowest of defeats.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>JUIC (1-2) v. MS (1-2)</span></strong><br/><span>AJ  and ZM combined for 136 points, just barely more than Phil or Pat  scored this week. If it hadn&#8217;t been for massive production by the Ravens  D/ST (18) and Detroit kicker Jason Hanson (17), this match would have  been even lower scoring. ZM had four players who combined for zero: two  guys with one, a zero, and Scrub of the Week James Starks with -2.  Starks got 11 carries for 5 yards. And fumbled. At least AJ is trying:  he had FIVE players with 8 or less who all should be in to double digits  on a regular basis. ZM on the other hand started Beanie Wells who was  held out of Arizona&#8217;s game against Seattle. He also started TE Dallas  Clark and WR Pierre Garcon, them of the decapitated Indianapolis Colts.</span></p>
