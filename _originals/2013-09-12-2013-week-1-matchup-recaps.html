<p class="lede">Week 1 action featured a number of surprises, with some notable poor performances from high draft picks.</p>

It seems like every team this week had a high draft pick implode, while some other dude stepped up with a huge game. Let&#8217;s get into it with the Week 1 recaps.
</p>

    Is this how you felt about your first round pick this week? You&#8217;re not alone.

<p>
Incredibly, Max goes to 1-0 despite putting up the second lowest score of the week. I&#8217;m really regretting the grade I gave his team. Not only did he manage just 70 points total, his bench guys were terrible too so he doesn&#8217;t have any promising reinforcements. Brady had a decent day with 17, albeit against a Bills defense missing their top safety. Welker hauled in six balls for 67 yards and a pair of scores but also got charged with a lost fumble for muffing an ill-advised punt return from inside his own 5-yard line. Starting the Cardinals D/ST worked out well also; they posted 11FP despite giving up 27 points, thanks to two takeaways and a defensive score. Elsewhere things were grim. First round pick Alfred Morris (7FP) only had 12 carries as the Redskins played from behind for the entirety of their Monday Night Football tilt against the high-flying Eagles. Incredibly, Roy Helu was on the field for <a href="http://www.hogshaven.com/2013/9/11/4704504/snap-judgments-week-1-vs-eagles">more snaps</a> than Morris. I can&#8217;t find snap counts by quarter, and even those might not answer the questions about this. It&#8217;s entirely possible Helu was in because he holds up better in pass protection and the Redskins had to throw and throw some more to get back in the game. On the other hand, Morris was involved in two turnovers. He fumbled on his first carry and the Eagles scored on the following play, taking the lead for good. Later there was some kind of confusion between Morris and Griffin which resulted in a botched pitch in the end zone and a safety. To be fair, it&#8217;s not clear whose fault this was and Morris made a heads up play to prevent a defensive touchdown. You can&#8217;t think Mike Shannahan was happy about any of this though.</p>
<p>Continuing down Max&#8217;s roster, Mike Wallace caught just a single ball for 15 yards and <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9652386/report-mike-wallace-miami-dolphins-not-happy-usage-win">aired his greivances publicly</a> after the game. However, I do see two positives for Max&#8217;s team going forward. First, the Jags will be upgrading to Chad Henne after Blaine Gabbert required <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/23545951/jaguars-qb-blaine-gabbert-needed-15-stitches-in-throwing-hand"><em>15 stitches</em> in his throwing hand</a> following Sunday&#8217;s game against the Chiefs. Moving from the worst quarterback in the NFL to merely a below-average is a boon for the fantasy outlook of Cecil Shorts (4FP). Second, Hakeem Nicks looked very good in the Giants&#8217; opener at Dallas with 114 yards on eight targets. While Victor Cruz remains the alpha dog in this receiving corps, Nicks is off to a fine start.
</p>
<p>
  As for Justin&#8217;s team&#8230; yikes. If Denarius Moore (10FP) is your second highest scorer you have some major problems. Despite playing the woeful Jets, Doug Martin managed just 65 yards on his 24 carries. Remember, this is the guy Justin took second overall, ahead of Adrian Peterson. Aside from Moore, Justin&#8217;s only other guy to break the double digit barrier was Cam Newton, who notched 14 against the stout Seahawks defense. Starting Cam over Eli was questionable, especially given that the Seahawks are more prepared to deal with mobile quarterbacks than most teams – their defense gets to practice against Russel Wilson, after all. Eli ended up with 33FP despite three turnovers, and would have put this in the win column for Justin had he been starting.

<h3 class="matchup-names">Dave v. Phil</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">The Sultan of Squats v. Shawp City Cake Beaters</h6>
<p>
Phil&#8217;s nine starters: 74 points. His five bench guys: 72 points. Ouch. While Phil got nice performances out of manystarters, four guys coming in under 5FP (including one at <em>negative</em> 5FP) is a killer. MJD&#8217;s performance – 15 carries, 45 yards – was the most unfortunate. It&#8217;s not clear yet whether the Kansas City defense is for real; if so, MJD has brighter days ahead. Russel Wilson contributed 15FP despite committing a turnover and set a personal best in passing yards. Still, the Carolina defense was able to get pressure on him and he&#8217;ll be hosting the Niners on Sunday. 15 from V-Jax, an anomolous 18 from Owen Daniels, and decent contributions from his defense and kicker would have provided Phil with a winnable matchup had David Wilson and T.Y. Hilton not floundered. 
</p>
<p>
  Things were rosier on the other side of the scoring sheet. Dave had six double-digit contributors, led by Aaron Rodgers&#8217;s 29-point outing in a losing effort at San Francisco. DeMarco Murray had 125 scrimmage yards on 28 touches, while Julio Jones and Mike Williams each found the end zone (10FP and 11FP respectively). In one of the bigger surprises this week, Browns rookie TE Jordan Cameron had a spledid debut, catching nine of the 13 balls thrown his way for 108 yards and a score. Dave&#8217;s only real disappointment was Ahmad Bradshaw who carried just seven times for 26 yards. He&#8217;s in more of a timeshare than many expected. On the bench, much-hyped rookie Gio Bernard was quiet in his first pro outing, though the Bengals were up against the staunch Chicago run defense. But fellow rookie DeAndre Hopkins was effective if not spectacular for the Texans; he reeled in six of his seven targets.

<h3 class="matchup-names">Nick v. Pat</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Steamin&#8217; Jimmy Beamen v. Hacksaw! Ball So Hard University</h6>
<p>
Sucks for Pat watching Max weasel out a win scoring 70 while he gets a loss putting up 112. Both Pat and I had a mix of flops and studs this week but our matchup was heading towards a blowout before Victor Cruz&#8217;s virtuoso performance (29FP) on Sunday Night Football. Matt Ryan pitched in 22FP, which is nothing to scoff at. Still, with the Saints doing little to shore up their historically bad defense in the offseason I thought Ryan was likely to approach 30. Young GZ, Steve Smith, and Frank Gore each chipped in double digits as well. But Arian Foster&#8217;s meager contribution – just 90 yards on 24 touches – was uh&#8230; not good. Further, Tavon Austin had an inauspicious pro debut and Antonio Gates caught just two balls.
</p>
<p>
  As for me, my guys were all over the place. Andrew Luck somehow rang up 28 despite throwing for less than 200 yards. LeSean McCoy was electric in the Eagles opener, notching 24FP behind 189 scrimmage yards and a score on 32 touches. Catching seven out of his 10 targets, Jordy Nelson racked up 130 yards and a score. And how about the Kansas City defense! They shutout the Jags offense, generated two takeaways and a touchdown, and nearly ripped Blaine Gabbert&#8217;s throwing hand in half. But it was the Jags. We&#8217;ll see how they fare against real competition when they host the Cowboys this weekend. I had some real stinkers too, though. I still think Dwayne Bowe has a nice season but he didn&#8217;t start off well. Steven Jackson was fine, but he only got 11 carries. And BenJarvus Green-Ellis was miserable (25 yards on 14 carries), but he was up against the Bears and did find the end zone. It&#8217;s nice to come out with a win and a strong point total but big question marks remain.

<h3 class="matchup-names">Hoop v. Brian</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">I&#8217;m Not a Star v. Pass, TDs. Pass and TDs.</h6>
<p>
I don&#8217;t want to backtrack all the way quite yet, but I may have made a mistake with Brian&#8217;s draft grade. RG3 was fine and looked to be shaking off the rust as the game progressed but he&#8217;ll need more out of him if the rest of the roster continues to struggle. First round pick Marshawn Lynch was only able to grind out 43 yards on his 17 carries, albeit against a Carolina defense that might be for real. Lamar Miller, the widely hyped starting back for the Dolphins was even worse. The unheralded Cleveland defense held him to <em>three yards on ten carries</em>. Pierre Garcon, the Redskins erstwhile deep threat, looked anything but explosive as he managed just 64 yards on his seven catches. This is not to say Brian&#8217;s team is devoid of promise, however. Brandon Myers (12FP) was more involved in the Giants offense than expected, Matt Forte (15FP) produced well – though he averaged just 2.6 YPC – against a strong Cincy defense, and Brian Hartline had 114 yards and a score while riding Brian&#8217;s bench. But if things don&#8217;t improve for Lynch and Miller, Brian will have a tough road ahead.
</p>
<p>
  First, the good: Hooper&#8217;s NFC North trifecta (Adrian Peterson, Brandon Marshall, and Matt Stafford) combined for 67. Shane Vereen and Danny Amendola were the only productive New England position players (25FP combined) and Hoop started both of them. Lottery ticket tight end Julius Thomas, who was on the bench this week, snagged two of Peyton&#8217;s seven touchdowns in the season opener. Then, the bad: Adrian Peterson&#8217;s gaudy 28FP performances was inflated by three touchdowns, including a 78-yard touchdown. Aside from that he only got 15 yards on his other 17 carries. I mentioned Reggie Bush&#8217;s long catch-and-run above, which gift wrapped nine fantasy points for Stafford. Finally, Vereen and Amendola both suffered injuries. Vereen broke a bone in his hand on his first carry and underwent surgery this week; he won&#8217;t be eligible to return until Week 11. Amendola aggravated a lingering groin injury and likely will miss tonight&#8217;s tilt against the Jets. Hoop&#8217;s 115 points is nothing to scoff at but keep in mind the huge (and rare) plays that fueled that total. Oh and Zach Sudfeld didn&#8217;t catch a pass and sustained an injury too.

<h3 class="matchup-names">Ali v. Paul</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Bartender! New Team Please v. Only Winners Get Wings</h6>
<p>
This was yet another matchup with a mix of huge and miserable outings. Like Pat, Paul was dealt a loss after putting up strong numbers. Ali&#8217;s success was largely due to monster games from Colin Kaepernick and the Cowboys defense. The latter gobbled up an impressive six takeaways, took two of those to the house, and had 30FP despite allowing the Giants to score 31 points. Kaep put on a passing clinic against the Packers, tossing for 412 yards, three touchdowns, and no turnovers. Larry Fizgerald looked rejuvenated with Palmer under center as he grabbed eight balls for 80 yards and a pair of scores. But there were holes here too. First round pick C.J. Spiller managed just 56 yards on 22 touches, and lost a fumble to boot. Ali&#8217;s non-existent depth at receiver also bit him in the ass, with Lance Moore coming up with just two catches for 23 yards on his four targets. Still, can&#8217;t knock a 120-point day too much and if Spiller, Tony Gonzalez, and DeAngelo Williams do well this year – and I think they all will – Ali will be in good shape.
</p>
<p>
Paul had a fluky week and, more concerning, may have some injury concerns going forward. Reggie Bush was phenomenal in his Lions debut with 191 scrimmage yards and a touchdown on just 25 touches for 25FP. Take this with a grain of salt though; 13 of those fantasy points came on a 77-yard catch and run touchdown. Big plays like that are great but they don&#8217;t come around all that often. Moreover, Bush suffered a dislocated thumb during the game, although he did continue to play.

<p>
  Apparently he also strained his groin. Ouch. Only time will tell how effective he&#8217;ll be after taking such a beating in Week 1. Tony Romo had a nice outing  (19FP) but also suffered an injury when he was sandwiched by two Giants defenders. Apparently his ribs aren&#8217;t broken but he seemed to be sore and moving gingerly for the rest of the game. Andre Johnson caught 12 balls for 146 yards while Jason Witten snared both of Romo&#8217;s touchdown passes (14 and 19 fantasy points respectively). The upside of the Romo-Witten duo is considerable. But like Ali, Paul had some big disappointments as well. His top two picks, Trent Richardson and Calvin Johnson, combined for a measly 10FP. A nice game from either would have likely turned this L into a W, but no such luck.

<h3 class="matchup-names">AJ v. ZM</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">The Chesapeake Ripper v. I Refuse To Acknowledge This Team Name</h6>
<p>
While AJ was a little lucky to escape with a win, I think his team will improve as the season progresses. Yes, Vick won&#8217;t put up 28FP every week, and who knows how long he&#8217;ll stay healthy, but the Eagles offense looks like the real deal. Shit, given what Chip Kelly wants to do, Nick Foles might be a better second option than Jay Cutler. Yes, Ray Rice&#8217;s 12 FP masks a rocky start, but running backs tend to not do well when their team plays from behind for an entire game. How about Randall Cobb and Vernon Davis though? The Packers-Niners game was a scoring orgy for AJ as he had a top-tier position player on each side of the ball. I think Kenbrell Thompkins, Chris Johnson, and Daryl Richardson all improve going forward. He has some nice bench options as well, with Miles Austin and Martellus Bennett both sitting out this past week.
</p>
<p>
  This is where that Roethlisberger at quarterback thing really fucks you. Getting just 10FP from your QB in this league is not a recipe for success. The lack of any deep threats and the crumbling Pittsburgh offensive line point to even bigger problems ahead for Big Ben. Thanks to a monster game from Demaryius Thomas (28FP) and solid outings by Jamaal Charles and Reggie Wayne (15FP each), ZM still had a shot in this one. But Dez Bryant&#8217;s 2FP and Vick&#8217;s MNF performance sealed the deal.
