    <p class="body-copy intro">Towards the end of each fantasy season the fun sort of starts to evaporate when you realize you are locked in a zero-sum melee with your best friends. Or, worse, you&#8217;re on the oustide looking in. With the new six-team playoff, #1 Zak and #2 Hoop were idle this week while I faced off against ZM, and Dave and Phil went for round two of their double-header. Dave and I were the two eliminated from the battle royale this week. It sucks, but it&#8217;s also kind of a relief. Here are the first round recaps.</p>

		<p class="body-copy">I can&#8217;t fucking believe I got beat down by a team called Orange County Gunners not once, but twice this season. ZM&#8217;s team has been on an absolute tear and he&#8217;s now taken six straight matchups. Lately it&#8217;s been all Cam, who put up a ridiculous 115 fantasy points over the past three weeks (41, 34, 40) and has run for just shy of 250 yards over that stretch with 10 total touchdowns and no turnovers. ZM got two monster plays from the Carolina offense, a 72-yard TD run from Cam (13 FP right there) and a short pass to DeAngelo Williams which he took 52 yards to the house (19 FP on that one). Take those to away and this one would&#8217;ve gone down to the wire. A gem from Matt Prater (15 FP) and V-Jax&#8217;s second best day of the season (19 FP) didn&#8217;t hurt either.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Things were pretty rough on my side of the score sheet even though I finished with a sorta respectable mark of 83. Matt Ryan had a workmanlike 22 despite throwing a pick. Reggie Wayne and Julio Jones both posted 12s with nearly identical outings. And the pick-up-and-start Browns D/ST netted 19 against the dismal Chiefs. But I got off to a rough start with a big fat donut from Brandon Myers on Thursday night, while Prater was nailing all four of his field goals, and was down 15 out of the gate. My only major decision this weekend was whether to use Torrey Smith or Ryan Mathews. Mathews is clearly safer, but his ceiling is so low, and ZM&#8217;s team has been so hot, that I figured I had to hope for a home run from Smith. Smith reeled in just a single ball for 22 yards, while I enviously watched teammate Anquan Boldin grab two TDs. But easily the biggest disappointment was Bryce Brown. The Bucs have quietly been a ferocious run defense this year, allowing just 3.3 yards per carry. They were able to hold Brown, who had 347 yards on just 43 carries(8.1 YPC) over the two prior weeks, to zero fantasy points with six yards on 12 carries. The only positive about this whole thing was that I trailed pole to pole and never really had any hope. Yes, that&#8217;s supposed to be a positive.</p>

		<p class="body-copy">Dave&#8217;s success this year was built on RG3 and the Chicago D/ST. Going against Brady this week he needed those two to come through in the clutch. Instead they faltered when it mattered most. RG3 was fine, with 18 FP, though he did leave early with a sprained knee. The Bears D/ST was terrible however. They didn&#8217;t have an answer for Adrian Peterson and only generated a single turnover against the slumping Christian Ponder. After starting out 7-1 with a commanding lead in the division the Bears have dropped four of their last five games and will be lucky to limp into the playoffs. A big part of this collapse has come from the inability to maintain the unsustainable defensive scoring barrage they enjoyed in the early season. Trent Richardson&#8217;s day was bailed out by two touchdowns; he managed just 42 yards on 18 carries (2.3 YPC) against the Chiefs, one of the league&#8217;s worst run defenses. Stevan Ridley also posted a decent 13-point outing, although with the game out of hand early much of the load went to the backs deeper on the depth chart. Other than RG3, Richardson and Ridley nobody on Dave&#8217;s squad exceeded 6 FP.</p>
		<p class="body-copy">Phil was down five going in to Monday night with Brady and Hernandez left to go for him and Ridley and New England kicker Stephen Gostkowski for Dave. At that point it was plausible, but unlikely, that Phil would lose somehow. Those chances largely rested on Houston&#8217;s ability to force turnovers from Brady which simply didn&#8217;t happen. While he was hit a handful of times, Brady absolutely carved up a Houston secondary that has been exposed over the past few weeks. He finished 21-of-35 passing for 296 yards and four touchdowns with no picks. That alone would have been enough to secure a resounding victory. The fact that Phil double-dipped on two TDs to Hernandez was just icing on the cake. Aside from that Patriots tandem nobody else on this team was particularly impressive. Steven Jackson (12 FP) was his third highest scorer with a stat line of 19 carries, 64 yards (3.4 YPC) and a touchdown. Phil has to be hoping big play guys like Randall Cobb and T.Y. Hilton step up up this week.</p>
