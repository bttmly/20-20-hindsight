<p class="lede">In a high-scoring week, eight teams reached triple digits as two of the previously undefeated teams fall.</p><!-- more -->
<h3 id="matchup1" class="matchup-names">Zak v. Max</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Brees: Fantasy Jesus v. The Super Snakes</h6>
<p>Well, Zak&#8217;s team is essentailly the Drew &amp; Jimmy Show, with weekly guest stars. The headlining duo put up a combined 62-point day which propelled Zak to a resounding come-from-behind victory on Monday night. Graham has six thouchdown catches through four games and Brees has slung 10 TD throws so far, with seven coming in the last two weeks. All of this is great for Zak as long as he gets at least one big contribution from somebody else. Last week it was Antonio Brown. This week Knowshon Moreno and the Buccaneers defense put up 14 and 15 respectively. But unless Stevan Ridley and DeSean Jackson start performing on a week-in week-out basis, he&#8217;ll continue to rely on anomalous performances from role players. Still, Zak&#8217;s 3-1 and owns a big chunk of the Saints offense, a unit which look as formidiable as any in the league this side of Denver.</p>
<p>As for Max, it&#8217;s always a bummer to reach triple-digits and come away with an L. Aside from Brady has been improving as he gains chemistry with his receiving corps, there are problems all over Max&#8217;s roster. His one real running back, Alfred Morris, is averaging under 10 points per game. Welker has been stellar (currently 3rd at the position) but the rest of his big-name receivers are all over the place. Hakeem Nicks has been dismal since his big opening day performance, although he is up against the atrocious Eagles secondary this week so maybe this is when he bounces back. Roddy White is still dealing with a nagging ankle issue, Mike Wallace has had just one strong game in four outings, Cecil Shorts is on the Jaguars, and Greg Jennings looks washed up. Well, he did until last week when he went off for 21FP out of nowhere. Max will continue to struggle picking the right receivers, but when he does hit his team can be as dangerous as anyone. But I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll hit often.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>Max<span>(2-2)</span></span><span>100</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Zak<span>(3-1)</span></span><span>123</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup2" class="matchup-names">Hoop v. Justin</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">I&#8217;m Not A Star v. Deez Nutz Reign On Your Parade</h6>
<p>Hoop really poured it on this week despite four single-digit performances and just 15FP from Matt Stafford. Adrian Peterson (26FP) had his first truly dominant performance since the season openeer, while the quickly improving Indy defense (also 26FP) showed just how bad Jacksonville really is in a 37-3 beating. Torrey Smith had one of his &#8220;yeah, that&#8217;s what he does like four times a season&#8221; games with five catches for 166 yards and a touchdown (22FP). Probably most frightening about Hoop&#8217;s team is that he has a starting running back—Ryan Mathews—<em>on his bench</em> and Danny Amendola returning to the lineup soon. This team is going to drop a ton of points on people this season.</p>
<p>The misery continues for Justin. Incredibly, his 80 total points in this matchup were his highest total of the season. Lack of production from his high draft picks has essentially sunk this team. To his credit, Justin is still actively trying to improve his team by adding and dropping players&#8230; but who is Jordan Todman? </p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>Justin<span>(0-4)</span></span><span>80</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Hoop<span>(3-1)</span></span><span>121</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup3" class="matchup-names">Nick v. AJ</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Steamin&#8217; Jimmy Beamen v. The Chesapeake Ripper</h6>
<p>On Sunday morning (early afternoon) a score alert from the fantasy football app woke me up, informing me I was already up 81-3 in this matchup. Once again the Chiefs defense (23) absolutely killed it. So far this season that unit has 90FP total (22.5 avg.) with 12 takeaways and three touchdowns. They&#8217;re allowing just opposing teams just 10.25 points per game. All the usual caveats about small sample size apply, and two of their games came against the Jags and Giants. Still, they held the Eagles and Cowboys to just 16 points each. They&#8217;ll regress towards the mean sooner or later, but this is still a very good defense. Oh, and Le&#8217;Veon Bell put up 19FP in his season debut.</p>
<p>AJ&#8217;s team will struggle until Ray Rice and Chris Johnson justify their draft positions. Rice&#8217;s (1FP on 5 carries) problem is a severe lack of carries, while Johnson (3FP on 15 carries) is getting plenty of carries but can&#8217;t seem to do anything with them. On the bright side, Kenbrell Thompkins (18FP) looks like he&#8217;s the real deal, and Brady is clearly gaining confidence in the young receiver. Getting Randall Cobb back from bye will help AJ&#8217;s team considerably, as will the eventual return of Miles Austin. Another problem has been Michael Vick falling back to earth after two huge weeks to start the season. If everything breaks right, AJ&#8217;s team still has the talent to do major damage. But while we&#8217;re only four weeks into the season, the odds of that happening seem to be falling.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>AJ<span>(2-2)</span></span><span>65</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Nick<span>(4-0)</span></span><span>110</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup4" class="matchup-names">Ali v. Dave</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Bartender! New Team Please v. The Sultan of Squats</h6>
<p>After three weeks of less than inspiring production from Darren Sproles and Tony Gonzalez, Ali can thank these two for lagely powering his victory. Sproles was incredible, helping the Saints move the ball in big chunks whenever Jimmy Graham was double-teamed. He had 142 scrimmage yards and two total touchdowns for 22FP. Gonzales was even more impressive. It was clear during the New England-Atlanta game that the Patriots were not going to allow Julio Jones to beat them. But Gonzalez (26FP) gashed them to such an extent that when Atlanta was deep in the red zone trying to tie at the end of game, the Patriots lined up two defenders <em>on Gonzalez at the line</em>. Other than that, Ali&#8217;s team was pretty pedestrian. As usual, Ali&#8217;s first round running back, CJ Spiller (7FP) is underperforming badly. He&#8217;s just 33rd in points at the running back position. Like many other teams, bad play from high draft picks is holding Ali back.</p>
<p>If you take a quarterback in the first round, you expect to lose the matchup during his bye week. That&#8217;s just how it is. It didn&#8217;t help that Dave went with EJ Manuel to fill in. But, like, dude, how about JORDAN CAMERON? Through four games he has 360 yards and five touchdowns! Finding guys like this in the later rounds is how you win fantasy football. On the other hand, having DeMarco Murray as your RB1 is how you lose. Stay tuned.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>Dave<span>(3-1)</span></span><span>79</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Ali<span>(2-2)</span></span><span>125</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup5" class="matchup-names">Pat v. Brian</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Hacksaw! Ball So Hard University v. Hurry Up With My Damn Croissants</h6>
<p>This is what you want when you draft Arian Foster. Not necessarily the 22FP, although that&#8217;s nice. No, what you&#8217;re banking on is touches, and Foster had 33 this week, good for 171 scrimmage yards and a receiving touchdown. This was a big week for a number of Pat&#8217;s somewhat disappointing players, including 18FP for Frank Gore, 19 for Antonio Gates, and 22 for Victor Cruz. With 25FP from Matt Ryan, Pat had this one sewn up easily. For now everything is good, but I think bye weeks are going to his this team particularly hard since his bench depth is practically non-existent.</p>
<p>Really tough beat for Brian this week, with solid performances nearly across the board. But goose eggs from Stevie Johnson and Brandon Myers and a 1FP contribution from Sebastian Janikowski crushed him. Aside from that, he&#8217;s somehow still chugging along despite RG3&#8217;s disappointing season (14th at position). In particular, his running back brigade of Marshawn Lynch, Matt Forte, and the rapidly improving Lamar Miller looks formidable. I&#8217;m shocked that Brian is 1-3 at this point actually, but if RG3 can somehow get back on track I think that record will come up quickly.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>Brian<span>(1-3)</span></span><span>93</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Pat<span>(2-2)</span></span><span>123</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup6" class="matchup-names">Paul v. Jenny</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Only Winners Get Wings v. Niner Faithful</h6>
<p>Even Peyton Manning can&#8217;t do everything by himself. While he&#8217;s leading all fantasy scorers by a mile, the rest of Jenny&#8217;s lineup didn&#8217;t provide enough support this week. Yeah, the Seahawks D/ST (20FP) continued to crush it, and Anquan Boldin had 15FP. But the rest of the roster was pretty gruesome, and AJ Green has been utterly disappointing following his huge Week 1 game. The return of Eddie Lacy from concussion and bye could provide a big boost, if he does still firmly hold the starting job. Unless Peyton hits 40FP every game for the rest of the way I see more losses like this coming here and there.</p>
<p>I called it out early on, Tony Romo was the steal of the draft. Getting a top-10 quarterback in the fifth round gives Paul a real advantage through the rest of his roster. Although this specific week he had some fluky guys go off on the same week (Bush and Washington specifically—22FP each), Paul&#8217;s team is above average. It&#8217;d be even better if he hadn&#8217;t let go of Le&#8217;Veon Bell, but we already covered that. I mean, his biggest issue is figuring out where to insert Danny &#8220;Darren Sproles West&#8221; Woodhead. That&#8217;s not a problem many teams in our league have.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>Jenny<span>(3-1)</span></span><span>104</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Paul<span>(2-2)</span></span><span>125</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup7" class="matchup-names">ZM v. Phil</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Orange County Gunners v. Shawp City Cake Beaters</h6>
<p>In the ugliest matchup of the week, the SoCal O-Fer Showndown, ZM got off the schneid with a win over Phil. ZM started the Pittsburgh defense. They&#8217;re currently 31st at the position. Out of 32 teams. He&#8217;s also still carrying Michael Floyd, who went down with a gruesome injury in Week 2 and is now on IR. Looking at some of the point totals on ZM&#8217;s team makes it hard to believe he had just 89. Then you realize Kyle Rudolph, Darren McFadden, Steelers D/ST, and Josh Brown combined for <em>zero points</em>. This is the offical thin ice warning.

<p>Hey Phil, I think it&#8217;s time to switch to Philip Rivers.</p>
