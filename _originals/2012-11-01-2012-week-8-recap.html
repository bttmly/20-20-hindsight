<p class="body-copy">After last week four teams (Hoop, Jenny, Zak, and myself) were knotted up at 5-2. By defeating me Hoop advanced to 6-2 and is in the driver&#8217;s seat for the top playoff seed. Jenny and Zak lost to Phil and Brian respectively. Phil&#8217;s victory propelled him to 5-3, while Dave advanced to the same mark by demolishing ZM&#8217;s UNSET LINEUP. </p>

  Aside: ZM – &#8216;the fuck bro!? You started two guys on bye and a guy on IR. Not acceptable. I realize you&#8217;re 2-6 now but when you don&#8217;t set your lineup it gives whoever is lucky enough to play you a free win. Everybody else – suggestions for disciplinary action?
</blockquote> 
<p class="body-copy">So Hoop is leading the pack with five teams right behind at 5-3. Brian and Ali are one game back at 4-4. In week 9 four of those top six are in action against each other so everything is still fluid. </p>

<p class="body-copy">I&#8217;ve discussed fantasy points for and points against repeatedly in these. The view I&#8217;ve taken is that points for (PF) should have no correlation with points against (PA). Now, there is no plausible way they can be actually related, but look at this scatterplot of our league&#8217;s PF/PA numbers.</p>

<p>
 The strength of that association is extremely weird. While you&#8217;d expect the teams with .500 or better records to be towards the top on the PF scale, they mostly happen to be way up on the PA scale for no apparent reason. To give you an idea of what I would have expected, it would be something <a href="http://i46.tinypic.com/25kk6xj.png">like this</a>. That&#8217;s leaving aside the huge anomaly that is Mr. Philly D. He&#8217;s had–by far–the fewest points scored against him, but is also the third to last in PF. Incredibly, he&#8217;s one of the 5-3 teams.</p><p>Here are the week 8 recaps&#8230;</p>

<p class="body-copy">Brian benefited from two great matchups: Big Ben against the Redskins and Eric Decker against the Saints. Roethlisberger piled up 26 FP, including three touchdowns, against the miserable Washington secondary while Decker snagged two touchdown passes against New Orleans&#8217; abysmal defense. Another big contributor was Sebastian Janikowski, who kicked four field goals and a pair of extra points for 14 FP. The other three Raiders on Brian&#8217;s roster all did fine as well which should be a given against Kansas City. The only disappointment was 6 FP from the Falcons defense against the turnover-prone Eagles. Hakeem Nicks and Ahmad Bradshaw were underwhelming, as has often been the case this season. If Nicks can&#8217;t get back to 100%, and Sidney Rice keeps improving, Brian could be tempted to weigh these two on matchups when setting his starters</p>
<p class="body-copy">In real football, Eli has been fantastic this year. In fantasy, he&#8217;s been good. But not last week. He had been averaging just over 19 FP per game, but was held to a meager 4 FP against the Cowboys. While the Giants did pile up 29 points in that contest they had just one offensive touchdown–a 1-yard run by Andre Brown. The other TD was a pick-six by JPP, and Lawrence Tynes contributed five field goals. Rob Gronkowski ran wild in London with eight catches for 146 yards and a pair of TDs (26 FP), and Miles Austin hauled in 133 yards worth of passes. The Packers D/ST kicked in 16 FP. Despite Eli&#8217;s bad outing, this one would have been winnable but for the disaster at running back. Shonn Greene was fine (9 FP) but Ray Rice&#8217;s bye week and Jenny&#8217;s non-existent depth at running back forced her to pick up and start a guy named Jamie Harper, who is apparently the goal-line guy in Tennessee. He carried once for -1 yards. Now that Hoop is in sole possession of first place, Jenny will likely be changing her name to &#8220;Sharing 2nd w 4 People Sucks&#8221; or something to that effect.</p>
<p class="scoreboard">Brian 96 (4-4); Jenny 84 (5-3)</p>

<p class="body-copy">Thank God for Tom Brady, eh Phil? Tommy Boy threw for four touchdowns and 304 yards (36 FP) in the Patriots-Rams beatdown. Aside from Brady, Phil&#8217;s only other double-digit contributor was the ever-reliable Niners D/ST (14 FP). Steven Jackson and Alex Greene were disappointing as usual and the Rams usage of Jackson is still sinking. Phil, I told you to pick up and hang on to Daryl Richardson. He&#8217;s now sitting on Zak&#8217;s bench and he actually outscored S-Jax this week. Andre Roberts and Randal Cobb were decent(ish). But, besides Brady, nobody had to do any heavy lifting as Zak&#8217;s squad struggled almost across the board.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Zak had six guys score five or fewer points last week, and four of those were <em>two</em> or less. Even if everyone else plays well that still makes it hard to win, and everyone else did not play well. After cruising along with three straight 35+ FP outings Drew Brees only managed 17 FP against Denver. Chris Johnson is paying off (so far) for Zak with 10 FP this week and he didn&#8217;t really lose much given that he wouldn&#8217;t have been starting either of the guys he traded away–Christian Ponder and Dez Bryant. Zak&#8217;s one monster performance, a 22 FP day from Titus Young, was sitting on the bench. This should be encouraging going forward though; with Nate Burleson out for the year with a broken leg the WR2 job in Detroit is Young&#8217;s to lose. Rookie Ryan Broyles has looked good in limited action but Young should be the primary beneficiary of the relentless double-coverage on Calvin Johnson.</p>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<p class="body-copy">Dave steamrolled ZM, whose lineup featured Andre Johnson (bye), Bill D/ST (bye, and shouldn&#8217;t be rostered anyway), and Fred Davis (IR). FUCK YOU, ZM. Dave&#8217;s team is looking strong right now and he managed to reach 94 points with just a 13 FP day from RG3. ZM&#8217;s team is awful, and it doesn&#8217;t help when you have Steve Smith and LeSean McCoy on the bench.</p>
<p class="scoreboard">Dave 94 (5-3); ZM 32 (2-6)</p>

    <span class="matchup-names">AJ v. Pat</span>
    <span class="matchup-teams">// NO WORK TODAY v. TOWN TAXES</span>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<p class="body-copy">I&#8217;m not really sure why Pat agreed to trade Michael Vick to AJ just before their matchup. AJ would have been forced to go dumpster diving for a QB given that Flacco and Schaub were on bye. Vick managed to stay clean on turnovers for the first time this season (I think) and put up a decent 17 FP. AJ also got big days out of his two stud receivers, Brandon Lloyd and Percy Harvin. While 12 of Lloyd&#8217;s 14 FP came from a pair of touchdowns, it was still encouraging to see him in the endzone.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Tony Fucking Romo. Jesus. The guy threw four picks against the Giants which completely fucked Pat&#8217;s chances here. It didn&#8217;t help that Pat was sitting at -6 after the Vikings got manhandled on Thursday night. Marshawn Lynch ran all over Detroit to the tune of 16 FP, while the above-mentioned Lawrence Tynes had a monster 19 on five field goals. But surprisingly bad days from Pat&#8217;s other big name guys killed his numbers and his chance to get back to .500. Lesson learned: Tony Romo will always break your heart, either with four picks when you start him or 38 FP on your bench.</p>           
<p class="scoreboard">AJ 67 (2-6); Pat 66 (3-5)</p>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<p class="body-copy">Peyton Manning is probably the best value pick of the draft at this point in the season. Aside from a bad week two outing against Atlanta, Peyton has put up 24 FP or better every single week and has thrown three TD passes in each of his last four games. Even though he throws some wobblers at times he has minimized his mistakes with just two turnovers since the Atlanta game. And he definitely carried Ali through an off-week in fantasy with a 30-point day. On Sunday, Jamaal Charles mysteriously disappeared. Even head coach Romeo Crenell <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/10/29/romeo-crennel-doesnt-know-why-jamaal-charles-only-got-5-carries/">doesn&#8217;t seem to know what happened</a>. Then the Cowboys were able to basically take Victor Cruz out of the game. Finally, Vernon Davis continued his cold streak on Monday Night Football (3 FP). But Ali&#8217;s deeper receivers covered him, with Denarius Moore and Mike Williams putting up 15 and 12 respectively. Ali is at 4-4 now and if his top guys get more consistent he&#8217;ll be extremely dangerous.</p>
<p class="body-copy">When your top scorer is the Raiders D/ST (18 FP), you need to re-evaluate your team. What a fucking mess. Philip Rivers is done as a relevant fantasy option–he&#8217;s averaging just 12.4 FPPG this season, exactly the same as Brandon Wheeden. Reggie Bush started the season at a torrid pace but has regressed to exactly what everyone thought he was before the season started: nothing special. Any week Max doesn&#8217;t get 30+ points from his Bears–Brandon Marshall and Matt Forte–he has basically no shot at winning. Obviously having AJ Green on bye is not ideal, but it&#8217;s the quarterback situation that&#8217;s sinking this team. Oh yeah, also, get a different kicker. The Saints score TDs at the highest rate in the league.</p>

<p class="body-copy">Ugh, not again. Losing with the second best score in the league is the absolute worst. I really wanted to start Chris &#8220;Long Bomb&#8221; Givens this week but ended up sitting him in favor of Rashad Jennings. Although the difference between those two was exactly the margin of victory, I would have lost anyway on tiebreakers so I&#8217;m not that irritated with myself. And with Arian Foster on bye I didn&#8217;t really think I had a chance this week anyway. My guys mostly did well this week, especially the Atlanta Young Guns. Matty Ice and Julio linked up five times for 123 yards and a score and combined for 47 FP. Like every other player, Willis McGahee had a field day against the Saints amassed 18 FP. But the fumbles were a night; each of the three running backs I started lost a fumble. In the case of Ryan Mathews or Rashad Jennings it cost them a third of their points. I&#8217;ll be glad to get Arian Foster back.</p>
<p class="body-copy">If you see Hooper&#8217;s team put up 115 you assume Rodgers had a big day. Not so much. Rodgers managed just 16 FP against Jacksonville, who, let&#8217;s just say, isn&#8217;t particularly known for defense. No, the guys who put a beating on me were Doug Martin and the Dolphins D/ST. Martin went for a staggering 32 FP on Thursday Night Football, with 12 of those points coming on a short pass he took for 60+ yards and a score. AP also played in TNF and put up 15 of his own so Hoop had already scored 47 FP by Friday morning. That&#8217;s a big whole. Then the Dolphins put it away by obliterating the Jets. The Phins sacked Sanchez four times, picked him off once, blocked two kicks (one returned for a TD), recovered a fumble, and held the Jets to 9 pointsn for 25 FP. Hoop now has sole possession of first place and is sitting at 6-2.</p>
