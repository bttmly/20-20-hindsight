<p>Of the six week 2 matchups, four were determined by single digits&#8230;<br/><br/><strong>TUSK 118; SPAU 116</strong><br/>Phil (TUSK; 2-0) was able to edge out Andre (SPAU; 1-1) thanks to Vincent Jackson&#8217;s massive game versus the Patriots. He also got double digits from Steve Johnson, Ray Rice, Dwayne Bowe and of course Drew Brees. These were the second and tied-for-third highest scoring teams of the week.<br/><br/><strong>JUIC 100; MARC 98</strong><br/>ZM (JUIC; 1-1) narrowly defeated Jordan (MARC; 0-2) with LeSean McCoy&#8217;s two TDs, as well as double-digit help from both his D/ST and kicker. The Chargers D/ST totally fucked Jordan here&#8230; it scored him -3 and cost him the win.<br/><br/><strong>LINC 116; ZAK 108</strong><br/>Jenny&#8217;s squad (LINC; 1-1) had four players over 15 points and another two in double digits, allowing her to defeat the 63 point Brady/Maclin duo Zak (ZAK; 0-2) fielded. Not helping his cause was a doughnut from Sidney Rice, who sat out with a shoulder injury.<br/><br/><strong>DEM 107; HUH? 101</strong><br/>I (DEM; 1-1) lucked out and held on to a narrow lead over Ali (HUH?; 1-1). After being down early, big performances from Miles Austin and Matt Ryan closed the gap. Hakeem Nicks wasn&#8217;t able to single-handedly take back the lead.<br/><br/>&#8230; there was one solid victory&#8230;<br/><br/><strong>CHUG 104; MS 79</strong><br/>Dave&#8217;s (CHUG; 2-0) balanced scoring was too much for AJ (MS; 0-2), who had two goose-eggs. Dave got double digits from his TE, D/ST <em>and </em>kicker, balancing out poor performances from DeSean Jackson and Mike Tolbert. AJ had Cam Newton (28pts) and Peyton Hillis (21) benched.<br/><br/>&#8230; and one blowout<br/><br/><strong>TWS 122; BREH 75</strong><br/>Reigning champion Max (TWS; 2-0) extended his win streak with a statement win over Patrick (BREH; 1-1). Pat was the top scorer in week 1 and looked poised to knock off Max; instead Max scored the most points this week and Pat the fewest. Despite getting only 3 points from fourth-overall pick Arian Foster, Max dominated the matchup. Darren McFadden has averaged 19.5 pts for the past two weeks, and looks set to continue to rack up the points. More impressive, Max had some big scorers benched. Pat&#8217;s effort was hampered by injuries to Michael Vick and Braylon Edwards.</p>
