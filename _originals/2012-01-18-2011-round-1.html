<p><em> Originally posted 12/13/11</em><br/><br/><strong>Max (TWS) v. Dave (WILL)</strong><br/><br/><strong>MAX</strong><br/> After cruising to 10-0, Max stumbled a little towards the end of the season. First, he suffered a 29-point defeat to Phil in Week 11, and a 5-point loss to Dave this past week. What&#8217;s more, both of those teams are in the playoffs. In fact Max is playing Dave again this week.<br/><!-- more --><br/> The big worry for Max is his running back corps, which has been crumbling due to injury. First, Darren McFadden, who averaged 16.7 through 6 weeks went down with a foot injury in week 7. After initial reports of a minor sprain and weeks of &#8220;hopefulness&#8221; about McFadden&#8217;s condition, questions have been growing and his injury was recently revealed to be more severe than first thought.<br/><br/> But McFadden&#8217;s injury didn&#8217;t derail Max, as he had Arian Foster and Matt Forte also on his roster, He also added breakout rookie DeMarco Murray after he took over the starting job in Dallas following Felix Jones&#8217;s injury. Things took a turn for the worse in Week 13 when Matt Forte was injured early in Chicago&#8217;s embarrassing loss to Kansas City. He will almost certainly miss the remainder of the fantasy season. (By the way, according to Wikipedia, Matt Fort√© has an accent on that E.) <br/><br/> Still, a combination of Arian Foster and DeMarco Murray, along with Max&#8217;s increasingly solid wideout group, was a dream lineup. And then Murray had to go and fracture his ankle. Now down to a single healthy RB (Foster), Max was forced to go dumpster-diving among free agent RBs today. With plenty of roster space created by injuries (and loading up on kickers and defenses for some reason), he picked up Jackie Battle, Kahlil Bell and Chris Ivory. <br/><br/> I believe Chris Ivory is the best play. The Saints will be playing a dismal Minnesota team and have almost no chance of losing. However, they are preparing to make a deep playoff run and want to have their bruiser Mark Ingram healthy and ready to go. Their other main back, Sproles, is a speedy mismatch as a pass catcher out of the backfield and they will also want to be sure he is healthy. The result? I&#8217;m guessing double-digit carries for Ivory. Kahlil Bell may see some added touches as punishment for Marion Barber&#8217;s blunder that cost the Bears the game last week. But the Bears are still trying to make the playoffs, although those hopes are dimming, and Barber gives them a better shot to win than Bell. As for Battle, he&#8217;s gotten at least 8 carries in each of the last 9 weeks, but hasn&#8217;t broken fantasy points or scored in the last 6. The upside appears minimal. Arian Foster he will have ridiculously tasty matchup against the Carolina Panthers, who are 31st in the league against running backs. Looking at their defensive numbers against RBs, it appears that running backs torch the Panthers when catching passes, which is something at which Foster excels.<br/><br/> The bright spot for Max is his wide receiver group. AJ Green has been simply stunning all year; looking at his fantasy stat line doesn&#8217;t do him justice. His catches often border on the ridiculous, and he and Dalton seem to be on the same page just about every week. Victor Cruz has similar chemistry with Eli Manning (whom Max will also be starting), and is fourth in points among all WRs this year. He has 5 games over 110 yards and 9 games with at least 6 catches. I would consider him the second best free agent add this year, after Cam Newton. He also has Marques Colston, who has shown intermittent flashes of brilliance. Colston&#8217;s problem is the surfeit of targets for Drew Brees, but he&#8217;s a threat for 15+ every week. On top of that, Green and Colston are going up against two of the league&#8217;s worst defenses against WRs: St. Louis (28th) and Minnesota (30th) respectively. Cruz will go against Washington, which is ranked 4th against WRs. Still, the Giants wideouts ripped the Redskins for 192 yards in Week 1, and good quarterbacks have done fine against the Skins. <br/><br/> Another potential spot for Max to find some points is in the D/ST slot. He&#8217;s got the Bengals defense against the Rams, who are worst in the league against opposing defenses. Defenses playing the Rams have averaged 13.1 points a game, and only missed double digits twice all season (Dallas and Cleveland both had 8). They&#8217;ve allowed at least 7 TDs to opposing D/ST units, and give up over 3.5 sacks per game. The Bengals D/ST has been opportunistic against struggling teams like Jacksonville, Indy and Seattle and I fully expect them to feast on St. Louis.<br/><br/><strong>DAVE</strong><br/> Dave started out a perfect 5-0 until he dropped three straight starting in Week 6. He recovered to finish 9-5 and clinched the 4th playoff berth last week. His team has benefitted hugely from Aaron Rodgers&#8217; incredible season, and over 30% of his total points from the season have come from Rodgers. However he has scored by far the fewest points total of any of the playoff contenders with 1298; Pat is the next lowest with 149 points more. His team has struggled at times, largely due to disappointing draft picks.<br/><br/> Clearly Rodgers, whom Dave selected 6th overall, has paid off in spades. But he selected Frank Gore, DeSean Jackson and Ryan Matthews with his 2nd, 3rd and 4th picks. Gore has had a solid year, but ranks 14th among running backs and has been somewhat underwhelming considering his draft position. DeSean Jackson has been downright miserable, ranking 30th among wideouts and hitting double digits just 4 times in 13 games. Finally, Ryan Mathews has had some excellent games, but he had a midseason slump which coincided with Dave&#8217;s three-game slide. Mathews has also shared carries with Mike Tolbert all year, and the Charger&#8217;s RB touchdowns have been split 8/4 in Tolbert&#8217;s favor. Incidentally, Dave has Tolbert on his roster as well and has often started both Chargers runnning backs. Dave also drafted Ryan Grant, whom he later dropped, and Vernon Davis, who has been up and down all year. <br/><br/> Nonetheless, Dave won his playoff spot by a two-game margin and has good reason to be optimistic about the first round. Rodgers is up against the Chiefs defense and could put up stunning numbers this week. The Chiefs have allowed big games to a number of so-so signal callers, but their average versus QBs is deceptively low. The Chiefs were up against the Raiders when they trotted out both Carson Palmer and Kyle Boller, who combined for 6 picks and -4 fantasy points. They also held Chicago backup Caleb Hanie to -1 in Week 13. However they&#8217;ve been shredded for 25+ four different times, and not one of those games was against a truly elite quarterback. Ryan Fitzpatrick and Matt Stafford have each had 4 TD games against the Chiefs, while Mark Sanchez and Matt Moore put up 27 and 29 respectively. This game is a lock for a blowout, but Rodgers&#8217; production could take a hit if he sits early. If not, 40+ wouldn&#8217;t be surprising.<br/><br/> Another soft matchup appears to be Demaryius Thomas against the Patriots. After initially favoring Eric Decker, Tim Tebow has been throwing more in Thomas&#8217; direction lately. He has 26 and 13 in the past two weeks, and the Patriots secondary has been awful. They give up the most points in the league to opposing wideouts, averaging 29.5 per game. In an insightful analysis last week on SportsCenter (couldn&#8217;t find an article or I would link it), Trent Dilfer explained why you see so many receivers wide open on Broncos highlights. His basic premise is that Tim Tebow under center can create confusion on every play, similar to, and especially effective with, play-action. Tebow divides the attention of defensive backs and causes them to hesitate at the worst times, resulting in blown coverage. He doesn&#8217;t have to be a pinpoint passer because he can often lob it to a wide open receiver. Demaryius Thomas has excelled the past two weeks, and his speed advantage over Eric Decker allows him to exploit these defensive miscues more easily. Add the Tebow factor to a dismal secondary? Thomas could be set up for a big day.<br/><br/> Also tempting is the Seahawks D/ST against the Bears. The Seahawks are tied for 5th in the league in interceptions and the Bears offense has been downright impotent since Jay Cutler went down.<br/><br/> On the other hand, Frank Gore will face the stingy Pittsburgh run defense, while Mathews and Tolbert will square off against the even stingier Baltimore squad. DeSean Jackson will have the Jets&#8217; secondary all over him, and even with Vick back I don&#8217;t see big numbers here. <br/><br/><strong>COMMISSIONER&#8217;S PICK</strong><br/> Max<br/><br/><strong>Pat (BREH) v. Phil (TUSK)<br/></strong><br/><strong>PAT</strong><br/> Go take a look at Pat&#8217;s team. He has SIX players that are top-3 at their position. He has the top 3 receivers in the NFL. Eight of his guys are owned in 100.0% of leagues (only Phil has as many 100%ers).<br/><br/> I don&#8217;t really know how to describe Rob Gronkowski&#8217;s dominance this year, especially considering he is a tight end. Most start-able tight ends average around 7 to 9 points a game, with a few impressive ones grabbing double digits on a regular basis. By comparison Gronk is averaging 15.3 a game. Last week I was screwing around with our league&#8217;s stats to try to find a quantifiable way to gauge how much value a particular player was worth given where they were drafted. <br/><br/> I used four variables:<br/> - Position Pick (PP): where a player was drafted relative to others of that position (so Vick would have a PP of 2 since he was the second QB chosen even though he was 10th overall)<br/> - Position Rank (PR): where a player ranked relative to others of that position in fantasy points so far this season, calculated after Week 13.<br/> - Position Median (PM): Median of the top X players at that position. For RB and WR, X = 30. For other positions, X = 12. <br/> - Season Points (SP): Player&#8217;s total fantasy points through Week 13.<br/><br/> with this formula:<br/> (PP)/(PR) * (SP)/(PM)<br/><br/> The (PP)/(PR) term shows how valuable the player is at his position compared to where he was drafted. The (SP)/(PM) term shows the percentage of the median the player achieved. This turns out to do a pretty decent job of showing value. I called this Composite Pick Value or CPV (yeah it sounds stupid).<br/><br/> A good example of a high value pick is AJ Green. He is 10th among WRs but was drafted 23rd among WRs (100th overall), and has exceeded the median by 16.7%. His CPV is 3.85. <br/><br/> Gronk&#8217;s CPV is 28.67.<br/><br/> Also impressive: Pat had 3 of the top <br/> 5 CPV players this year: Gronk, Welker and Jordy Nelson. Welker and Nelson have CPVs of 17.08 and 11.37 respectively.<br/><br/> (Note: this formula goes up rapidly for players ranked very highly at their position because it means the denominator of the first term decreases towards or to 1. Gronk is not necessarily 7.5 times more valuable than AJ Green. A logarithmic expression would be better for calculating relative value since all players with CPV less than 1 would get a negative value. CPV has a minimum of 0. The lowest CPV I calculated for any player was Jamaal Charles who was drafted very highly and hurt very early; his CPV is .003. However a player like Peyton Manning who scored no points this season would have a CPV of exactly 0 because if SP=0 the whole formula is 0.)<br/><br/> But Pat&#8217;s team is not without flaws, and those flaws are squarely located in the top 3 roster spots. 3rd round pick Ahmad Bradshaw missed a significant portion of the season with injury and has been invisible in his two games back. He has an easy matchup with the Redskins defense this week, but he&#8217;ll be sharing carries with Brandon Jacobs. Shonn Green (5th round) has exploded in the past two weeks, and he also has an easy matchup but given his past inconsistency its hard to be confident about his chances here. But the biggest hole in Pat&#8217;s lineup is at quarterback. He used his 1st round pick on Michael Vick, who has been plagued with injury and hasn&#8217;t been his 2010 self when on the field. After an outstanding 2010 campaign that was particularly notable for offensive consistency and a dearth of turnovers, Vick has been erratic all year. While he had 25 or more in 4 of his first 7, he began to fall apart in Week 9. He later missed three games in a row and was mediocre in his first game back last week. He will go up against the Jets in Week 15, who are 5th against QBs this year. His other option is Joe Flacco, who has also struggled all year. Last year he threw 25 TDs against 10 interceptions in 16 games with a career-high 93.6 passer rating. Through 13 games this year he has just 15 TDs with 9 picks, on pace for a career-low 79.9 passer rating.<br/><br/> Another problem for Pat is the defensive attention Calvin Johnson has garnered lately. In the five games since the Lions&#8217; week 9 bye, he has just 1 touchdown and one game in double digits. This is after pulling in 11 touchdowns in his first 8 games. He is almost always double covered and his opportunities for big plays have fallen dramatically. But he&#8217;s playing the Raiders this week and they have been less than impressive against WRs, so he should see some chances this week. <br/><br/> Jordy Nelson should do well against the KC defense; however with Greg Jennings sidelined he will attract more attention from the secondary. Wes Welker is also looking at a favorable matchup against the Broncos. As strong as the Broncos have been on defense lately, they won&#8217;t be able to contain the Patriots passing offense. The Bears will face the Seahawks in what figures to be a low scoring game at Soldier Field. Both defenses have looked good lately, and Tavaris Jackson has struggled against solid defenses, which the Bears still are. Finally, I expect the Cowboys to march all day against the Bucs and Dan Bailey should get a few FG chances. He&#8217;s only had fewer than two attempts twice all season.<br/><br/><strong>PHIL</strong><br/> Phil&#8217;s team is staggeringly good, and at this point I think he has the best shot at the championship considering Max&#8217;s extensive injuries. <br/><br/> At the top is Drew Brees, whose record-pace season has been overshadowed by Aaron Rodgers. Still, Drew Brees has been downright incredible. He has exceeded 300 yards passing in every game this season except 3. He had a midseason hiccup in which he threw 8 interceptions in 4 games, but has only thrown 3 since and none in the past 4 games. Against the Colts (admittedly, on their way to 0-16) he threw for 5 TDs and only missed on 4 passes all game. He also ran for a score in that contest. And in the season opener against the Packers, despite losing, he showed that if any team knocks off the defending champs in the playoffs it will probably be the Saints. On the other hand, they have two mystifying losses: one to the Rams (2-11), the other to the division rival Buccaneers (4-9). But not to worry. Brees and the Saints will face the Vikings in Week 15, who allow the most points to QBs in the NFL. Like the Packers-Redskins game mentioned above, Brees fantasy output can only be limited by his playing time, but New Orleans coach Sean Payton doesn&#8217;t mind running up the score, as he showed when the Saints obliterated the Colts 62-7.<br/><br/> Another huge contributor is Ray Rice, who has been outstanding both as a runner and pass-catcher. Rice has been the focus of a Baltimore offense that is struggling at many other positions, and is second among all RBs in fantasy points this year. Another bright spot on this roster is Roy Helu. After relentless changes in the Redskins backfield for most of the season, Helu finally put a stranglehold on the job in week 12 and hasn&#8217;t looked back. In the three weeks since he&#8217;s gotten 23, 23 and 27 carries along with 13 receptions in those games.<br/><br/> The true breakout star of this roster is New Orleans tight end Jimmy Graham. Graham has 8 touchdowns this season, which Phil has accumulated double points from since he also has Drew Brees. While his output hasn&#8217;t matched that of Gronkowski, he is fourth among all players in CPV this year.<br/><br/> His receiving corps has been disappointing after a huge start to the season. Dwayne Bowe has been worst of all, having no TDs and no double digit games since his Week 6 bye. <br/><br/> The 49ers D/ST, however, is 3rd in the league and has been incredible at generating turnovers.<br/><br/><strong>COMISSIONER&#8217;S PICK</strong>:<br/><big>Phil</big></p>
