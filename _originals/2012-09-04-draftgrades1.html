<a class="post-title bottom left" href="http://20-20hindsight.tumblr.com/post/30920542394/"> Grading the Draft: Part 1</a>
<!-- more -->
<div class="perma-only">
<p><br/> First off thanks again to everyone who came over the other night for the draft, that was a ton of fun even though Max didn’t quite have a full-on panic attack. <br/><br/> Many fantasy analysts talk about needing a balance of safety and risk on a roster, and advocate taking the most consistent, reliable guys early then stocking up on fliers or lottery tickets later. This makes a lot of sense to me, and is the main way I will be grading each person&#8217;s draft. In certain cases the upside on a risky player can be so huge that it can justify an early pick; this was my logic with Julio Jones and I will also be considering this. The percentage numbers beside each grade are there to differentiate between drafts with the same grade. Also, I will be posting the spreadsheets used for this post later on in the week. Here are some quick examples of two picks hated and two I liked.</p>
<h3>Hated</h3>
<p><strong>Cam Newton in the second round</strong><br/> This was an extremely risky move so early in the draft. Yes, he exceeded expectations in absolutely every way possible last year and has skills no other starter in the league possesses. On the other hand, his numbers declined sharply towards the end of last season. Plus the Panthers added goal line specialist Mike Tolbert. Basically the upside is limited (seems unlikely he&#8217;ll repeat last year&#8217;s performance) and the downside could be huge (if the drop off in production at the end of 2011 indicated defenses were beginning to figure him out). The tradeoff here is huge; rather than Cam, ZM could have drafted a surefire stud like Jimmy Graham or Wes Welker and waited for a more stable QB option like Eli, Rivers, or Ryan, each of whom I would say is as likely as Cam to end up top five by the end of the season.<br/><br/><strong>Nate Burleson in the 12th round</strong><br/> This guy has basically no upside. Nate Burleson is who he is at this point in his career. He&#8217;s 31 and will probably be overtaken sooner rather than later by a younger talent on the Lions&#8217; depth chart. His 73 receptions last year is a surprisingly high number, but he only took those catches for a total of 757 yards and three scores. In comparison, Mike Williams came off the board about a round later. He was underwhelming last year after a big rookie year, but his numbers were comparable to Burleson (65 rec, 771 yds, 3TD). He beat Burleson&#8217;s yardage with 10% fewer catches, and will be just 25 this year. The Bucs struggled across the board last year and if they bounce back Williams should return to relevance as well. On the other hand Burleson&#8217;s Lions ran a wide open passing attack last year that will likely come back to earth somewhat this season.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Liked</h3>
<p><strong>Tom Brady second overall</strong><br/> With the caveat that every player in the NFL can suffer a crippling injury at any moment, Brady is as close to a sure thing as you can get. Sure, his 2011 numbers weren&#8217;t as gaudy as Rodgers or Brees. But the guy has an impressive resume, a ridiculous track record, and the Patriots added the one thing their offense was missing when they signed Brandon Lloyd to be their deep threat. That isn&#8217;t to say aren&#8217;t some concerns; the Pats&#8217; O-line was questionable in the preseason and Brady is entering his mid-thirties. That said, since we&#8217;re talking about minimizing risk, I believe Brady is the <em>least</em> likely to finish <em>outside</em> the top three quarterbacks among Rodgers, Brees, and him.<br/><br/><strong>Alshon Jeffery in the 12th round</strong><br/> While people were already drafting defenses and kickers (the positions with the worst year-to-year consistency), AJ was busy scooping up lottery tickets. Sure, it&#8217;s more than likely that Jeffery has a mediocre or worse rookie season on a team struggling for second place in the division. But the upside on Jeffery is huge: he&#8217;s 6&#8217;3&#8221;, 216 lbs. and runs a 4.47&#160;40. Furthermore, he&#8217;s playing across from a potentially elite receiving threat in Brandon Marshall, who already has a track record of chemistry and success with quarterback Jay Cutler. While defenses are busy trying to contain Marshall, Jeffery may be able to take advantage of single coverage. Picking up guys like Jeffery is like hunting for the next Victor Cruz; it&#8217;s very unlikely you&#8217;ll find him, but if you do it will pay off in spades, and there are ways to increase your chances. First, obviously, you want a guy whose quarterback can actually throw the ball. Say what you will about Cutler, but he&#8217;s not Blaine Gabbert, and he won&#8217;t cap his receivers upside with simple ineptitude. Second, you want a young guy playing across from an established threat. This is why people were reaching for players like Brandon LaFell (across from Steve Smith with Cam at QB), Kendall Wright (across from Kenny Britt with cannon-armed Jake Locker at QB), Titus Young (across from Megatron with Stafford at QB), and Michael Floyd (across from Larry Fitz), most of whom might have gone undrafted had everyone simply followed ESPN&#8217;s rankings. <br/><br/> With that in mind, down to business. </p>
<h3>Hooper</h3>
<p>Hoop started things off by drafting Aaron Rodgers first overall, and given our league awards six points for passing scores it would be hard to choose anybody else with the top pick. He then snagged Jimmy Graham and AP back to back, which were also nice choices. With Graham and Rodgers he has two of the premier players at the two <a href="http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/fantasy-football-draft-guide-how-to-outsmart-the-competition/">most consistent</a> positions in fantasy football. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m on board with AP as RB1 with a huge gap until the next pick; if he doesn’t come back strong you have a serious problem at running back. It&#8217;s important to remember not only the severity of his injury, but that it occurred at the very end of the season, giving him much less recovery time than, say, Jamaal Charles who tore his ACL week one. On the other hand, by foregoing running backs with his first two picks he was left with a meager group of RB1&#8217;s and obviously if AP returns to form by week three this pick will definitely pay off. With his next pair he snagged Antonio Brown and Doug Martin. I love the Brown pick at 16th WR taken, as I think he&#8217;ll make a strong push for top five numbers this season. His teammate Mike Wallace is coming off of a long holdout and will have to learn a new offense very quickly, a task which is much harder for receivers than backs. Further, the Steelers&#8217; running game has been decimated by injuries so I expect them to rely on the pass more than they have the past few years. With the Martin pick, again, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m on board. While he was a hot topic during training camp as he shot up draft boards, I still think the carry split between him and LeGarrette Blount will be at least 65/35 (Martin/Blount) if not closer to 60/40. Additionally, rookie running backs need time to learn the pro game and I think it&#8217;s premature to expect him to make a big splash immediately. The big gap between Hoop&#8217;s second/third picks and fourth/fifth cost him some serious strength at RB2, with a number of serviceable options coming off the board, and this is probably his weakest sure starter. With his sixth and seventh round picks Hoop rounded out his receiving corps with Eric Decker and Kenny Britt, both of whom could be big contributors this year. After that he went after a number of high-risk players and eventually hit the limit of eight wideouts. This necessarily leaves him with thin depth at running back, especially since his RB3 and RB4 are currently clear backups, albeit behind injury-prone starters. On the other hand if he hits gold on one of his late receiver picks (Brandon LaFell would be most likely) he could easily deal a receiver for a running back. I feel the biggest mistake here was waiting too long to handcuff Toby Gerhart given AP’s uncertain health and effectiveness, however with the monster gap between his picks he would have needed to reach for Gerhart at his eighth/ninth round back-to-back.</p>
<h4>FINAL GRADE: A- (92%)</h4>
<h3>AJ</h3>
<p>Interestingly, my top two draft grades go to the first pick and last pick. It’s very surprising they were able to build such strong teams as the large gap between picks makes it difficult to anticipate who will be available when their next pick comes up. AJ began by grabbing DeMarco Murray and Fred Jackson back-to-back, securing his top two running backs and allowing him to go after other positions with more depth later on. Jackson was outstanding last year before his injury, leading the league in yards from scrimmage before he went down with a broken leg. Further, for a running back a broken leg isn’t the type of injury that is worrisome long-term, unlike a ligament tear. Murray’s short track record is a little worrisome, but the guy is obviously a stud when healthy. With his next back-to-back he grabbed Brandon Lloyd and BenJarvus Green-Ellis, both of which I think were solid picks. BJGE is a solid, if unspectacular runner, and many teams would like to have him as a RB2. AJ gets to plug him in as the flex which further improves his value. As for Lloyd, the knock on him has been there just aren’t enough balls to go around for all the receiving talent in New England. But Lloyd has shown the ability to make the most of what he gets, and even with a few catches a game he could be devastating down the field. Moreover, I have no idea how defenses are planning to stop the Patriots offense when Welker, Lloyd, Gronkowski and Hernandez are on the field at the same time. If and when Brady gets Lloyd in single coverage on the outside expect great things to happen. With his five/six back-to-back AJ grabbed Jermichael Finley and Percy Harvin. As a former Finley owner myself, I’ll admit to being a little biased, but I hate that pick, especially since Antonio Gates and Aaron Hernandez were still on the board.</p>
<blockquote><div>(Quick aside: I think both Gates and Hernandez will have big seasons. Gates wasn’t entirely healthy at all last year and with V-Jax gone he’s the only guy Rivers trusts. According to reports out of training camp the Pats are reengineering their offense to run through Hernandez, who may see snaps from the backfield and split out wide in addition to playing tight end. Depending on his usage, its not out of the question that ESPN makes him RB-eligible at some point.)</div></blockquote>
<p>However going after Harvin with the first pick of the sixth is a strong move. He’s the only solid receiving target on his team and he somehow makes Christian Ponder look like an above average quarterback. Try these numbers on for size: only four wideouts caught 70% or more of their targets in 2011, and Harvin was one of them. The others were Wes Welker, Marques Colston, and Jordy Nelson. And over the second half of the 2011 season Harvin was the most targeted player in the NFL, finishing the year seventh in receptions among all players. AJ’s main misstep was failing to pick up a starting quarterback with his three/four back-to-back, as all the solid starters came off the board before his next pick, with Rivers being taken just two picks before AJ got a shot at him. He had to wait until his seventh/eighth round picks to nab a quarterback and got stuck with Matt Schaub. While Schaub is certainly a capable quarterback, the Texans’ system limits his upside by running more often than any other team in the league. (I probably would have gone with Cutler there). He picked up Malcolm Floyd right before Schaub and Felix Jones and Joe Flacco with his next pair of picks. The Floyd pick is so-so, I hate Felix Jones, and Flacco could go either way. His next pair though was exactly what you should be looking for in the later rounds. He doubled up with Jacquizz Rodgers and Alshon Jeffery with his 11/12 back-to-back. Michael Turner isn’t getting any younger and it would be surprising if Rodgers didn’t see a substantial number of snaps this season. His elusiveness and speed could make him very dangerous, especially when catching short passes out of the backfield. Alshon Jeffery is another one of the later-round high upside receivers I mentioned before. He&#8217;ll be working across from Brandon Marshall so he should have opportunities to shine. AJ grabbed Danny Amendola with his 15th pick, which I think is another nice add. Amendola plays on a shitty offense, and isn’t really a stud. But he’s established a role there and it would be surprising if he didn’t lead his team in targets this year. The Rams can’t get much worse than they were last year, and even players on a bad team can put up numbers if the volume of touches is high enough. I would put a player like Davone Bess in this same category.</p>
<h4>FINAL GRADE: B+ (88%)</h4>
<h4>Dave
Dave started off aggressively by snagging Matt Stafford with the sixth overall pick. By any measure a 5000+ yd. / 40+ TD season for a quarterback places him among the elite at his position. But unlike the top three quarterbacks Stafford has substantial risk. First, he played in just 13 of 32 games over his first two years in the league. Second, the Lions have no running game to speak of so defenses can dedicate their attention to the pass. Third, with more game film of Stafford running the Lions offense teams will have better ways to counter the Lions’ air attack. That said, Stafford is clearly a highly talented quarterback with a monster arm and he has excellent chemistry with Calvin Johnson, the best receiver in the universe. We’ll have to wait and see if he can match his 2011 stats, but my feeling is Stafford ends up closer to 4000 yd. / 30 TD than to his totals from last season. Dave went after Larry Fitzgerald in the second round, which I think is also a little too risky. But if any wideout can produce despite mediocre quarterback play it’s Larry Fitz. He grabbed Trent Richardson and Jordy Nelson with his next two picks, both nice adds given the available talent at their position. Dave’s biggest misstep occurred in the fifth round when he drafted Stevan Ridley. Admittedly the RB talent was already pretty thin by the 53rd pick, but this is why you usually try to take two RBs in the first four rounds. But the Patriots use a running back by committee system, and despite rumors out of training camp I don’t expect that to change this year. Sure, Ridley might get <em>most</em> of the carries, but with their pass heavy offense that doesn’t guarantee a heavy workload. Plus, expect them to work in Danny Woodhead and Shane Vereen when they want to mix things up. He got back on track with Antonio Gates in round five, who was somehow the fifth TE taken. Despite his mediocre season last year during which, I&#8217;ll remind you, he was playing with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsophalangeal_joint_sprain">turf toe</a> which is far more painful than it sounds, he’s still an elite talent at his position, and should have certainly been the third tight end to go. Next Dave grabbed Donald Brown who was ranked absurdly low by ESPN; sure, he’s nothing special but he’s the clear starter and will get a bunch of touches. In the eighth round Dave picked up Titus Young, one of the major buzz guys of this offseason. People expect Young to break out this year, as he is a solid receiver in his own right, plays across from the best receiver on the planet, and has a strong and accurate quarterback. We’ll see if this pans out, but I will admit I was targeting him as well. Next Dave went after RGIII in the ninth, which I think was a so-so move. He still had some positions to shore up (ahem&#8230; running back), and relying on a rookie QB, even as a backup, is always a little hinky. Aside from going after a defense and kicker kind of early, Dave finished with a string of nice upside picks including Daniel Thomas, Reuben Randle, and James Jones. I think Dave’s team may have the most individual talent, but we’ll see if his guys (especially his first four picks) can reach their potential.
FINAL GRADE: B (86%)</h4>
<blockquote><div><em>Incidentally, if I had to try and make an objective judgment I would grade my draft as slightly weaker than Dave&#8217;s.</em></div></blockquote>
<h3>Jenny</h3>
<p>With four quarterbacks coming off the board in the first six picks and Calvin Johnson going seventh, Ray Rice incredibly fell to eighth where Jenny snapped him up. She followed this up by grabbing Gronkowski with the 17th pick. I’m not sure I love taking Gronk that highly; chasing last year’s touchdown totals rarely works and it’ll be almost impossible for the Gronk Monster to match his stats last year. Rule of thumb: when someone breaks records one season, expect them to come down to regress the next year. Still, he’ll obviously be productive, but it would be crazy to expect him to approach his 17 TD catch total from last year. In round three, Jenny reached for Eli with the 32nd overall pick. Again, I’m not sure I like this pick. While Eli approached 5,000 yds. passing last season he only threw 29 TDs and has only passed the 30 TD mark once in his career, and I rank him in the same tier as Rivers, Ryan, Romo and Peyton. These guys didn’t start coming off the board until the fifth round (well, Pat’s autodraft reached for Romo in the fourth but that shouldn’t really count). I would be surprised if Eli ended the year above more than two of those guys. Jenny followed up with two receivers in the fourth and fifth rounds, grabbing Marques Colston and Jeremy Maclin respectively, both of whom I really like. While Drew Brees likes to spread the ball around, Colston is awesome and Brees clearly trusts him. And with good reason: Colston led all wide receivers with a 75% catch rate last year (80 rec. / 8 TD on 107 targets). As for Maclin, the Eagles have had a year to jell since their free agent spending spree and they finally took care of DeSean Jackson who will presumably return to form. The Jackson/Maclin combo is a nightmare for defenses and I fully expect strong years from both of them. Jenny had waited until the sixth round to grab her second running back, leaving her with Shonn Greene at RB2, by far the weakest position on her roster. Greene took over full-time starting duties for the Jets last year and was thoroughly unimpressive. The Jets have apparently rededicated themselves to a run-first offense, but we’ll see how that goes. The team has been an absolute mess this offseason and it’s entirely possible they collapse altogether. On the other hand, if Greene improves with a heavier workload he could turn out to be a big time value pick. She picked up Miles Austin next. Austin&#8217;s balky hamstrings held him back last year but he still had flashes of his &#8216;09 campaign at times, but he has missed most of the Cowboys’ preseason condition with, yep you guessed it, a strained hamstring. Next she took the Ravens defense in the eighth round, a pick I completely hate. Again, defenses extremely inconsistent year to year. Plus the core of the Ravens defense is aging rapidly and star linebacker Terrell Suggs tore his achilles tendon in the offseason and will likely miss the entire season <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8052902/baltimore-ravens-terrell-suggs-november-return-unlikely-play-2012">(although he claims he&#8217;ll be back in November)</a>. She grabbed Isaac Redman in the ninth, another pick I dislike as it&#8217;s not clear exactly what the carry split between Redman and Jonathan Dwyer will be, plus it&#8217;s looking increasingly likely that Rashard Mendenhall <a href="http://www.sportsoverdose.com/topic/rashard-mendenhall-injury-update.html">will be back before too long</a>. Oh, and Redman is already hurt. In the 10th Jenny went after Nate Washington which was a very nice grab; Washington has huge upside, as he’ll be either playing across from Kenny Britt or serving as the primary option if Britt’s knees hobble him. Washington quietly piled up over 1000 yards along with 7 TD last season. If Jake Locker&#8217;s accuracy improves this season this offense could be dangerous. <br/> With the 128th pick Jenny reached for Packers kicker Mason Crosby, which I think is absolutely terrible. Again, kickers have the lowest year-to-year consistency of any position in fantasy football. I suppose the logic here is that Green Bay has a ridiculous offense and so should be in field goal range pretty often. Well that&#8217;s the kind of logic that can get you into trouble. The Green Bay Packers offense actually had the third <em>fewest</em> drives in the NFL last year. On top of that they ended drives with touchdowns at the highest rate in the league (37.5%), leaving them with just 28 field goal attempts on the year compared to the league average of 31.6 attempts. Plus Crosby&#8217;s 85.7% field goal rate just narrowly better than the league average of 82.9%. So what I&#8217;m trying to say is this was a terrible pick.<br/> Jenny ended the draft with a handful of so-so picks, including Randy Moss, James Starks, and Mark Sanchez (Ewwww! Although to be fair the autodrafters left a dearth of acceptable backup signal callers), before inexplicably snagging a backup defense with her last pick.</p>
<h4>FINAL GRADE: B (83%)
<em>Note: I think the next person&#8217;s draft is just as good as Jenny&#8217;s; I just wanted to break it into three parts to make it easy</em></h4></div>
