<p><span>Max  remains perfect at 6-0. Dave suffered his first loss of the season,  going to 5-1 and into a three-way tie for second with Pat and Philly D.  ZM picked up a game and is the only team sitting on 3-3. Five teams are  sharing the misery at 2-4: myself, Ali, AJ, Andre and Jenny. Finally Zak  and Jordan are wallowing at 1-5. The divide between good and bad  remains large, with only one team (ZM&#8217;s) arguably in between. Anyway,  enough self-pity, lets get to it&#8230;</span><span></span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>JUIC  80 (3-3); DEM 66 (2-4)</strong><br/>With  yet another miserable performance my average points per week slipped to  just over 75, the lowest in the league. And I was projected to post 117  points and win by 26! That shows you what a load of dogshit the ESPN  projections are. In week 6 the center of my lineup looked like a heap of  garbage on a Tenderloin street corner. Between my WRs, RBs and TE (six  players) I managed only 29 points. That means they were averaging less  than 5 points a piece. Remove Steven Jackson from that equation and the  average of the other five guys was only 3.6 (18 total)! Andre Johnson  and Julio Jones are going to need to get healthy quick to give me any  chance of avoiding ignominy. Actually, ZM&#8217;s team wasn&#8217;t all that much  better this week. LeSean McCoy did well as usual, and Sanchez had a  surprisingly solid outing but that was basically it. His second RB,  flex, two WRs and TE combined for just 26. Better than mine, but still  ominously bad.</span><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>BREH  117 (5-1); WILL 81 (5-1)</span></strong><br/><span>For  probably (not going to check) the first time this year, Pat&#8217;s highest  scorer wasn&#8217;t a receiver. Ahmad Bradshaw had a monster game with Brandon  Jacobs out, rushing for 3 TD and totaling 30 points. In fact, he scored  more points than Pat&#8217;s three star WRs combined (Welker 10, Johson 11,  Bryant 7). Vick also played well in  Philly&#8217;s big win over Washington.   Another big scorer was the Bears D/ST with 16 against the miserable  Minnesota Vikings. Dave&#8217;s top-loaded output couldn&#8217;t compare with Pat&#8217;s  consistency. Aaron Rodgers had yet another huge day, putting up 29  points in the Packers&#8217; blowout of the Rams. Meanwhile Frank Gore put up  20 in the Niners&#8217; upset over the Lions. After that though, things were  rough for Dave. He had no other player in double digits and got goose  eggs from both Vernon Davis and the Saints D/ST. Dave probably wishes he  had started Aaron Hernandez instead, who put up a clean 10 points. Pat  had by far the highest scoring squad this week, posting 117 when there  was only one other team over 100 (SPAU). He also had Jordy Nelson riding  the pine with 16. However it will be interesting to see how his team  does with Welker and Gronkowski on bye next week.</span><span></span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>HUH?  86 (2-4); MARC 67 (1-5)</span></strong><br/><span>Jordan  put up yet another disappointing week, with a number of should-be stars  underperforming. AP failed to get in to double digits, as did the Law  Firm, Steve Smith and Michael Crabtree. Plus Felix Jones suffered an  injury that will keep him out multiple weeks. Ouch. Cutler did well in  Chicago&#8217;s blowout win, and the Raiders D/ST had a special teams  touchdown. They also should have been credited for the fake FG TD throw  by Shane Lechler&#8230; c&#8217;mon ESPN! What gives? If that&#8217;s not some special  teams magic then I don&#8217;t know what is. Anyway, dismal outings by all the  WRs and RBs sunk this ship. He had surprise performances from his  bench: Cedric Benson (11) and Jerome Simpson (10).  Ali improved to 2-4  thanks to big numbers from the Jets D/ST which racked up 21 against Matt  Moore and the dismal Dolphins, and also from Fred Jackson who had yet  another big day. Jackson leads all non-QB players in points, and has an  astounding average of 19.8. Ali also started Ben Roethlisburger who had a  modest 14. Like so many other teams this week, however, the center of  his lineup was awful. His second RB, flex, two WRs and TE combined for  27 or just over 5pts apiece.</span><br/><span></span><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>TWS  99 (6-0); MS 67 (2-4)</span></strong><br/><span>Max  improved to 6-0 this week thanks to solid showings from six of his  starters. All but one of his WRs or RBs got 11 or more, with Arian  Foster nearing the double digit mark with 9. Although he has been  winning games with his three dominant backs, only Darren McFadden  reached the 15 point level. The emerging star was Marques Colston, who  seems to be commanding a big share of Drew Brees&#8217; attention now that  he&#8217;s healthy. Also impressive was the Bengals D/ST, which put up 16  versus Indy, validating Max&#8217;s streaming defense strategy of &#8220;grabbing  whoever is playing the Colts.&#8221; AJ&#8217;s team was so-so this week. Cam Newton  posted one of his lowest scoring games of the season with 14, while  Peyton Hillis put up a disappointing single point. The killer for AJ was  that he didn&#8217;t have any outstanding performances to build on. His good  players did alright, and his not-so-good players did badly. Against  Max&#8217;s squad, that&#8217;s a recipe for disaster.</span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>TUSK  99 (5-1); ZAK 81 (1-5)</span></strong><br/><span>With  a big 20 point game from his kicker, this game should have been way  closer Phil might appreciate. Drew Brees played a pretty bad (for him)  game, but still wound up with 17. But honestly 17 is not what you are  looking for from a top tier quarterback. Ray Rice did well as usual and  so did the combo of Earnest and Jimmy Graham who put up 24 combined.  Zak&#8217;s reliance on Tom Brady is becoming dangerous, especially as we head  in to the Patriots&#8217; bye week. Besides Brady, Zak had only two guys in  double digits – the inconsistent Jonathan Stewart with 12 and Jeremy  Maclin with 10. He misfired terribly by failing to start Jacboy Jones,  who took advantage of his big opportunity while Andre Johnson is  injured. Zak also sat the (high upside) Brandon Pettigrew while starting  the (no upside) Kellen Winslow. Next week this team will have a shot at  posting the lowest point total of the year – Zak doesn&#8217;t have a back up  QB on the bench and so will have to go out and grab a scrub from the  scrapheap. Plus Maclin is heading in to a bye as well, so expect things  to go from bad to worse.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>SPAU  101 (2-4); LINC 91 (2-4)</span></strong><br/><span>Somehow  Andre&#8217;s 10-point win was the closest of the week and he came away with  the GMC Never Say Never Trophy. That&#8217;s pretty ridiculous considering  it&#8217;s been 1 or 2 points every time through week 5. This was one of those  simple games: four double digit guys versus five double digit guys. It  is actually rather surprising that Andre managed to win after the  terrible decision to start John Kuhn, who predictably put up a donut.  Receivers Mike Wallace and Santonio Holmes also did well, posting 25  together, and SF kicker David Akers tacked on 13 of his own. Jenny&#8217;s  team was sunk by Roddy White&#8217;s two points, and by Matt Schaub&#8217;s  underwhelming 14. Michael Turner was the biggest contributor, going for  25 in Atlanta&#8217;s win over Carolina. Jason Witten also hit double digits  and the Eagles D/ST got 13 off of Washington, thanks largely to Rex  Grossman&#8217;s 4 picks.</span></p>
