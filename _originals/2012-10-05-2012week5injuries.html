<p>Occasionally I have to work late on Thursdays, which is a total bummer during football season. Last night was one of those nights and I didn&#8217;t get out of here until about 8:30. After checking out the stat lines from the Rams-Cardinals game though, it would have been impossible to pick a better Thursday game to miss. Here&#8217;s one that knocks both sides at once: the number of passes Bradford completed (7) was fewer than the number of times Kolb was sacked (9). The two teams combined for just 524 total yards. That&#8217;s passing plus rushing for both teams together. Seriously. Bradford passed for just 141 yards with 95 of those yards coming on just two throws, one to Chris Givens for 51 yards and the other to Danny Amendola for 44. Oh, and Amendola sustained a severe shoulder/collarbone that could sideline him for an extended period, and St. Louis basically runs their offense through that guy. On the upside for St. Louis: their defense is sneaky-good, especially the defensive line, and kicker rookie Greg Zuerlein (AKA <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Zuerlein_%28American_football%29">"Legatron"</a>&#8230; Holy shit, even better, Wikipedia lists another one of his nicknames as Young G.Z.) is sensational, going 4-4 so far this season from 50+ including a 60-yarder against the Seahawks last week. As for the Cardinals&#8230; well, there&#8217;s always some team that starts out hot before turning back into a pumpkin at midnight. Bill Simmons had Bill Barnwell on his podcast yesterday and they summed it up pretty well:</p>
<p><em><strong>Simmons:</strong> So who is this year&#8217;s Bills? I mean is it too obvious to say it&#8217;s Arizona?</em><br/><strong><em>Barnwell: </em></strong>Of course<em> it&#8217;s Arizona! Come on&#8230;</em></p>
<p>The bigger point here is that the NFC West could kind of maybe be one of the better divisions in the NFL and they&#8217;re doing it with defense across the board. Coming into the season the Seahawks were one of the hype teams, and were expected to field a ferocious defense , a bruising running game, and a good-enough passing game (does this remind you of another NFC West team perhaps?). Obviously the Niners were coming off one of the better defensive seasons in memory. But the sudden arrival of the Rams and Cardinals defenses has been surprising. Patrick Peterson is now both a shut-down cover corner <em>and</em> elite punt returner. Actually, while we&#8217;re on the topic, let&#8217;s throw special teams in here too. As mentioned above Young G.Z. looks like the real deal, and obviously the 49ers special teams are spectacular, and Arizona has Peterson. All four teams have been excellent outside the division, but these divisional games (see also: St. Louis-Seattle week 4) look like World War I trench warfare. When you see two NFC West teams going at it, take the under.</p>
<p>On to injuries! As usual, largely paraphrased from <a href="http://espn.go.com/fantasy/blog/_/name/bell_stephania/id/8463821/">Stephania Bell</a></p>

<p>Not a whole lot of surprises this week. As expected <strong>Hakeem Nicks</strong> will sit with injuries to his foot and knee and there&#8217;s no timetable for his return (sorry, Brian). With week 3 breakout star <strong>Ramses Bardem</strong> still trying to comeback from a concussion, <strong>Dominick Hixon</strong> will be playing across from <strong>Victor Cruz</strong>. Likewise, <strong>Greg Jennings</strong> could miss extended time with his groin injury, opening the door for some mix of <strong>James Jones</strong>, <strong>Randall Cobb</strong>, and <strong>Donald Driver</strong>. <strong>Kenny Britt</strong>'s sore ankle is still bothering him and he hasn't practiced all week indicating he could miss the Titans' Sunday tilt with Minnesota. The Vikings defense has been pretty stingy against wide receivers but this is still good news for the fantasy fortunes of <strong>Nate Washington</strong> and <strong>Kendall Wright</strong>. Saints receiver <strong>Lance Moore</strong> strained his hamstring and hasn&#8217;t seen the practice field all week; this is terrible news as Moore has been getting a good number of targets and seemed primed for a fantasy breakout eventually. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if <strong>Jimmy Graham</strong> and <strong>Darren Sproles</strong> saw 20 targets each this week. Other fantasy starting receivers who appear on the injury report but are expected to play at or near 100%: <strong>Pierre Garcon</strong>,<strong> Andre Johnson</strong>,<strong> Julio Jones</strong>, and <strong>Torrey Smith</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Forte</strong> was limited in practice but is expected to start on Sunday against the Jags. <strong>Reggie Bush</strong> should also play despite a banged up hip, and <strong>LeSean McCoy</strong> has a minor knee injury that likely won&#8217;t impact his status. <strong>Rashard Mendenhall</strong> will finally make his season debut this Sunday against the Eagles. Having him back should improve a Steelers running attack that has been dismal so far and reports out of Pittsburgh suggest he&#8217;s running great, but I won&#8217;t be starting him in fantasy until I see how effective he is in a game situation. <strong>C.J. Spiller</strong> and <strong>Fred Jackso</strong>n are both absent from the injury report so maybe we&#8217;ll see the Bills&#8217; plan for the workload split this weekend. On the other hand, they&#8217;ll be trying to run against the Niners so HAHAHAHA!</p>
<p><strong>Rob Gronkowski</strong> played through his hip injury last week so expect more of the same. <strong>Aaron Hernandez</strong> is apparently making a quick recovery from his high ankle sprain and returned to practice Thursday. I can&#8217;t see him playing this weekend but this is still great news for Phil - he&#8217;s currently starting <strong>Marcedes Lewis</strong> at tight end.</p>
<p>Good luck this weekend folks (except you Dave)! Come over for <strong>Niners-Bills this Sunday at 1:25</strong> if you&#8217;re up for it.</p>
