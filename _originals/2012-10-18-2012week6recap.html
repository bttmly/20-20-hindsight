<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure everyone watched the Sunday night game, but if you weren&#8217;t already aware, Aaron Rodgers <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQy-gTH0nN8">CRUSHED IT</a>. <!-- more -->I&#8217;ve been trying to come up with a few clever puns about the this beatdown. First I tried something with the Packers&#8217; name coming from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Packing_Company">meat packing compnay</a> and the Texans&#8217; mascot being a <a href="http://old.houstontexans.com/kids/toro.asp">bull</a> but I couldn&#8217;t make it come together. Couldn&#8217;t get anything to work with slaughterhouse either. The best I could come up with was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQy-gTH0nN8">Bulls on Charade</a> and that&#8217;s pretty weak. Anyway, long story short, Rodgers <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wK-3udTjUg">silenced</a> his critics, for the time being at least. There were surprises elsewhere as well – a shockingly listless Niners getting blown out by the Giants, the Steelers went down in flames against the bottom-dwelling Titans, Matt Ryan threw three picks, the Jets scored five touchdowns(!), the Seahawks edged out the Patriots, and craziest of all the Broncos fought back from a 0-24 halftime deficit and shutout the Chargers in the second half to win 35-24. Other, more predictable things happened also such as Jason Garrett sucking at coaching and Andy Reid sucking at coaching and personnel decisions.</p> <!-- more -->
<p>Regarding the injury report for this week: you don&#8217;t need it for the game tonight. You know who you&#8217;re starting (Vernon Davis, Frank Gore, D/ST for the Niners; Marshawn Lynch, D/ST for the Seahawks. These defenses are both too good to gamble on anyone else) so look for something short and sweet tomorrow.</p>
<p>By the way, these are becoming excruciatingly boring to write so I need to change things up somehow. Let me know if you have any suggestions. Also I made some slight style changes that might end up making certain headings harder to read on a phone. My long-term project is to create a layout for phone that looks exactly like the central column does on computer but that might take a while. Ultimately it will always look best on a computer because that&#8217;s where I write.</p>
<p>Enough of that – let&#8217;s get it.</p>
<h3>Hoop v. AJ</h3>
<h4>No Work Today v. The Whole World is a Couch</h4>
<p>In the Green Bay/Houston matchup, Rodgers scored 50 FP while Schaub managed just three. As it happens, AJ was starting Schaub and Hoop had Rodgers. Besides Percy Harvin (who is having an incredible season by the way) nobody in AJ&#8217;s starting nine mustered double-digits. DeMarco Murray was on track for a solid day but sprained his foot and left the game, with Felix Jones handling the work after that. Luckily for AJ he already had Jones on his roster so this isn&#8217;t a catastrophe. On the other hand, these mid-foot sprains can be a bitch; as numerous people have noted, last year a day-to-day foot injury for Darren McFadden became week-to-week then season-ending. And Felix Jones has a much more limited skillset than Murray. As far as Schaub goes, the struggle with this guy is he needs touchdowns to be productive and if he doesn&#8217;t get them he&#8217;s useless in fantasy. He hasn&#8217;t exceeded 300 yards passing in a game this year, and has thrown 210 or less in half his games so far. Making things worse, AJ&#8217;s other quarterback is in a somewhat similar situation. After coming out guns blazing at the beginning of the season the Ravens have dialed it back significantly on offense giving Joe Flacco the same sort of low-ceiling Schaub usually has. That said the rash of injuries in Baltimore might be a blessing for AJ. We&#8217;ll see how they do this week but it looks doubtful they&#8217;ll be able to trust their defense to hold on to leads. That means they&#8217;ll have to keep scoring on offense rather than force-feeding bulk carries to Ray Rice in the middle and later portions of games which oculd be a boon for Flacco&#8217;s fantasy value (and, incidentally, for my boy Torrey Smith). Obviously this is speculative at this point but it&#8217;s not a stretch given they&#8217;ve already had some success with an up-tempo offense. On the other side, it&#8217;s hard to knock a 127-point outing. Still, 50 did come from Rodgers alone, and given the big names on Hoop&#8217;s team his squad has been underacheiving. He is sitting at 4-2 and fifth in points scored, but c&#8217;mon. This team has Rodgers, Adrian Peterson, Jimmy Graham, Frank Gore, and two of the biggest off-season hype guys – Antonio Brown and Doug Martin. If Rodgers can get that 2011 mojo back (i.e. average 3 total touchdowns per week) Hoop will sail into the playoffs. If not, he better hope some of these guys improve dramatically.</p>
<h5>Hoop 127 (2-4); AJ 66 (1-5)</h5>
<h3>Nick v. Zak</h3>
<h4>Charlie&#8217;s $150 Dick Rash v. Chain Gang</h4>
<p>Good God, what a trainwreck. Let&#8217;s start with the Falcons. They have to be one of the worst 6-0 teams ever. They started the season by torching the Chiefs 40-24 – so far, so good. Then they faced a rusty Broncos team at home, picked off Peyton three times, but won by just six points after their defense seemingly fell asleep in the fourth quarter. That was kind of disconcerting. Then they held the Chargers to a single field goal in a 27-3 beating in San Diego. Back on track, right? Not so fast – the following week Ron Rivera punted away what should have been a Carolina win. Yikes. In week five they went up against the Redskins (2-2 coming into the game) and needed a touchdown late in the fourth quarter to break a 17-17 stalemate. Finally, in week six they were badly outplayed by the Raiders (1-3 going in) but somehow still found a way to win. Oakland <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=321014001">dominated</a> in time of possession (36:26 to 23:34), total yards (474 to 286), and a number of other categories. The Falcons lucked out with a defensive touchdown in the fourth quarter but this is really a game they should have lost. Four of their six wins have been by a touchdown or less which does not bode well. The Raiders, who hadn&#8217;t intercepted a ball all season, picked off Matty Ice <em>three</em> times. Overall this was just a terrible effort against an inferior team, and it definitely showed on the fantasy stat lines. Ryan finished with just seven FP, and Julio Jones only chipped in six. Things were as bad or worse elsewhere on my roster. Reggie Wayne wasn&#8217;t completely marooned on <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/flag-football-gang-green-cromartie-article-1.1183492">Antonio Atoll</a>, hauling in five balls for 87 yards, but he lost a fumble and wound up with just five FP. Rashard Mendenhall got dinged up early in the Thursday night tilt against the woeful Titans run defense and contributed a single point. Arian Foster did manage to muster double-digits (the only player to do so aside from my kicker) but 12 of his 15 points came from a pair of short touchdowns. The Packers completely bottled up Foster, allowing him just 29 yards on 17 attempts and a single reception for 12 yards. This was just a really frustrating week as a whole, with a bunch of soft matchups my guys should have exploited. This one was especially tough as I&#8217;m going into a two-week stretch where most of my main guys have byes so I could easily drop the next two as well. For Zak, the story is the same as always: miserable running back situation (four FP combined) with decent-to-good receivers and anchored by strong quarterback play. We&#8217;ll see if Michael Turner comes back rejuvenated after the bye but he was awful against the Raiders (11 carries, 33 yds.), a team whose run defense was gashed by the questionable rushing attacks of Denver and Miami. Kyle Rudolph has been a great asset – he&#8217;s currently third among tight ends in fantasy points – but his value is closely tied to his knack for touchdowns. He&#8217;s averaging only 37.5 yards per game right now but if Ponder starts looking his way outside the redzone he could become a monster. Zak is now tied for first in record but is down at <em>eighth</em> in scoring – must be nice to have opponents averaging 84.8 points (league avg. 92.3). I call on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">law of large numbers</a> to smite this apostate.</p>
<h5>Zak 83 (5-1); Nick 62 (4-2)</h5>
<h3>Brian v. Dave</h3>
<h4>We Got Nicks Like Jesus v. That&#8217;s No Moon</h4>
<p>Dave&#8217;s decision to start Stafford over RG3 was a disaster. Dave, did you check RG3&#8217;s status at all during the week? The consensus from early on was that he would start, and he&#8217;s been great in every full game he&#8217;s played. If he had concussion symptoms at all he would have been held out. What&#8217;s the basis for not starting him then? A perception that he would get fewer runs? Or that he would be skittish after taking his first big NFL hit? Well&#8230; whatever the reason: whoops. Robert &#8220;Black Jesus&#8221; Griffin III went off for 35 points. He had just 183 yards and one score passing, but exploded for 134 rushing yards and two touchdowns. So that&#8217;s 14 points left on the table right there (Stafford scored 21 FP). Dave also picked the <em>worst</em> time to finally bench Antonio Gates. After amassing just 12 FP (on 13 catches!) through the first five weeks Gates finally found the endzone – twice. He caught six balls for 81 yards and a pair of scores, while starter Heath Miller got just six. I can&#8217;t really fault the thought process but it&#8217;s still another 14 points left ont he table and that hurts. Even with those missteps it&#8217;s crazy that Dave lost this match. He started Jordy Nelson and James Jones, who between them reeled in five of Aaron Rodgers&#8217;s six passing touchdowns and scored 30 and 15 respectively. By the way James Jones has caught two TDs in each of the last three games which is beyond ridiculous. As mentioned above Stafford posted a solid 21 FP, while Larry Fitz managed 15 against the dismal Buffalo secondary. But as I noted last week Dave has been hanging his hat on his two top running backs, Stevan Ridley and Trent Richardson. Unfortunately Richardson had to exit early with a rib injury and is currently listed day-to-day; he put up just four FP before his injury. Ridley had to square off against the extremely stingy Seahawks front seven, gaining just 34 yards on 16 carries. Kicker Steven Gostkowski and the Miami D/ST grabbed 20 FP together for an impressive 114 for the week. Still, that wasn&#8217;t nearly enough to stop Brian&#8217;s league season-high 133 FP barrage. This is the most well-rounded team performance possible (AJ was really, really stoked about it). Every guy on his team chipped in double-digits although nobody topped 20. The Atlanta defense came up huge yet again with three takeaways and a touchdown against the hapless Raiders (19 FP). The Falcons have 3+ takeaways in four of six games so far which is just nuts. Atlanta safety and <a href="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/180jaf1dwrzwujpg/original.jpg">Cal product</a> (seriously, check out that picture if you want a laugh) Thomas DeCoud is tied for first in the NFL in interceptions with four already including the ball he snagged in the first quarter monday night. In case you don&#8217;t know who this guy is yet, <a href="http://deadspin.com/5947408">here he is playing the meow game</a> from Super Troopers on SportsCenter. Big Ben submitted a workmanlike 18 FP, though it came against the bottom-dwelling Tennessee defense. Darren McFadden was decent (12 FP) despite losing a fumble, although it took him 27 carries and three catches to get there. The Bills are working with a full-on timeshare in the backfield; CJ Spiller got 12 carries to Fred Jackson&#8217;s 16. But this is actually good news for Brian since Spiller seems most effective with limited work – he ran for 88 yards on 12 touches for a sparkling 7.3 YPC and also found the endzone. Just for shits, he also grabbed four balls for 22 yards. The bi3&gt;ggest surprise was Ahmad Bradshaw who was able to do the impossible: run on the Niners. The Giants played conservatively with a lead and fed Bradshaw the pill 27 times, which he took for 116 yards and a score. The Niners defense had seemingly folded by the fourth quarter, when Bradshaw piled up 54 of his yards.</p>
<h5>Brian 133 (3-3); Dave 114 (3-3)</h5>
<h3>Max v. Phil</h3>
<h4>Fuck You Aaron Sorkin v. The Bauce of Sauce</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m not even sure what to say about this one. Max&#8217;s team was <em>terrible</em> this week aside from a 25-point outburst from AJ Green. Have you noticed that Green has been, far and away, the best fantasy receiver so far this year? He leads the league in receiving yards with 628 (104.7 YPG) and has six TDs through six games, tied with Victor Cruz for second just behind James Jones. Anyway, aside from AJ Green&#8217;s monster performance, going into Monday night Max had nobody in double digits. Oh, and Alex Smith chipped in <em>-1</em>. Frankly, Phil&#8217;s team wasn&#8217;t strong either – Tom Brady (21 FP) was his only guy in double digits though he did have four different guys post nine FP. Still, he held a hefty 19-point lead over Max at Monday night kickoff with only the Denver D/ST left to play for Max. Obviously this seemed like a lock, especially when the game went to the half with the Chargers in complete control, up 24-0. Then, Philip Rivers happened. The Broncos stormed back largely thanks to Rivers&#8217;s six turnovers – two returned for touchdowns – and became the first team in NFL history to come back from 24 or more down and win by double-digits. Rivers was also sacked four times and the Denver D/ST unit piled up an incredible 33 FP to secure a stunning win for Max. Understandably, Phil was more than a little upset (here&#8217;s <a href="http://mojoimage.com/free-image-hosting-11/3345phil_text_combined.png">his reaction</a> to Max). On the bright side, I guess, is that Phil couldn&#8217;t have avoided this no matter what lineup he set. I feel like there should be some kind of recognition for stumbling ass-backwards into a win like this&#8230; the Max Van Broek <a href="http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l4voc82s121qb3riko1_250.gif">Stroke of Luck</a> Award? Maybe we can come up with something better. This will be awarded to anyone whose quarterback contributes negative points and who wins their matchup on Monday night (so probably nobody, ever again).</p>
<h5>Max 83 (2-4); Phil 69 (3-3)</h5>
<h3>ZM v. Pat</h3>
<h4>Orange County Gunners v. Town Taxes</h4>
<p>These squads each had a mix of good and bad this week. Sam Bradford had a surprisingly effective day with 23 FP and actually outscored Andy Dalton (Pat&#8217;s starter) by two. ZM totally lucked out on Mike Wallace who caught two balls for 94 yards and a score. One of those was an 82 yard touchdown which netted 14 points on a single play in a matchup where the margin of victory was 12. On Pat&#8217;s team the biggest disappointment was Marshawn Lynch who ran into the suddnely impenetrable New England run defense. Don&#8217;t look now, but New England has been absolutely smothering running backs who aren&#8217;t named Ray Rice. Right now Alfred Morris is the best free agent pickup of the year – he&#8217;s third in points among RBs and has had just one game in single digits and has reached the end zone five times so far. Pat&#8217;s stud receivers Roddy White and Calvin Johnson scored 13 FP each. On the downside Tony Gonzalez disappointing in his second single-digit outing of the season. Worse, the Vikings got smoked by RG3 and the &#8216;Skins and their D/ST scored -3. ZM&#8217;s team was more than serviceable especially considering the Panthers (read: his whole fucking team) was on bye. I hadn&#8217;t really noticed but Danny Woodhead has been a satisfactory fill-in for the past few weeks; in the last four weeks he&#8217;s yielded 9, 8, 6, and 6. Mike Wallace&#8217;s big, fluky day was mentioned above, but take a look at Vincent Jackson&#8217;s numbers: in five games he has two weeks with four or less, and three with 16 or more. You absolutely can&#8217;t rely on him but he came up huge this week (four catches, 66 yards, two TD). Although ZM did win this one, I&#8217;d like to note two hugely disappointing picks: LeSean McCoy and Andre Johnson, his first and third round picks respectively. He took LeSean first among running backs and he ranks way back at 13th at the position. Sure, he&#8217;s only been in single-digits once but his season high is 13, and he was taken <em>first</em> among running backs. For perspective, the 13th RB taken in our draft dwas in the third round (Steven Jackson; 27th overall). Ouch. Johnson has been awful too, sitting way down at 30th among WRs. ZM took him sixth at the position, 28th overall in the third round. The 30th WR was taken way back in the <em>seventh</em> round. I guess what I&#8217;m saying is, looking at the rosters of these two teams, I&#8217;m surprised they have the same record.</p>
<h5>Pat 78 (2-4); ZM 90 (2-4)</h5>
<h3>Ali v. Jenny</h3>
<h4>Chomo Se Dice: Bolsa De Bolsas v. Sharing 1st W 3 People Sucks</h4>
<p>Ali, I have a question: how does it feel to get your shit pushed in by Shonn fucking Greene? Greene had 15 points in the Jets&#8217; season-opening shellacking of the Bills. After that he had four or fewer FP in each of the next four weeks (2, 4, 3, 3). Over that period he carried 49 times for 123 yards – a dismal 2.5 yards per pop. Granted, three of those games were against Miami, San Francisco, and Houston which are three of the top run defenses in the NFL. Still, nobody (I&#8217;m sure this includes Greene himself) expected the 34 FP explosion on Sunday given his 5.4 FP average before kickoff on Sunday. Sure, the Indy front seven is bad, but this bad? Greene was given 34 carries on the day, presumably to ease the load on Sanchez who had thrown six picks in five games heading into the contest. He took those carries for 161 yards and three touchdowns. With Ray Rice piling up 22 FP and good-enough performances from her other guys Jenny put this one away early. Gronk is still a big disappointment but shit, she&#8217;s 5-1 so it&#8217;s all good at this point. On the other side, while Ali didn&#8217;t get it done this week, his team looks good enough to contend for the last playoff spot. His gamble on Peyton has paid off in spades as he&#8217;s currently third at the QB position. With the Broncos routinely playing from behind this doesn&#8217;t seem likely to change soon. Mike Williams has been emerging as anviable starting WR with three double digit games so far and a season best 17 FP this week. Denarius Moore is in that same category of unreliable WRs with high upside; he also posted a season-best outing this week with 16 FP. If these guys can gain a little consistency, Ali might just be able to get back on track especially with Darren Sproles and MJD coming off bye weeks.</p>
<h5>Jenny 110 (5-1); Ali 92 (2-4)</h5>
