<h3>Last Season</h3>
<p>Average points per game is calculated here by taking a player&#8217;s 2011 fantasy output and dividing by 16. Many of the players listed here missed one or more games due to injury, or gained a starting spot after the season was underway, and so their fantasy output per game played would be higher. However, the goal of this chart is not to indicate who specifically to draft, but rather to show how the quarterback position falls into tiers. Clearly, the top 5 quarterbacks were outstanding last year, but they also happened to avoid significant injuries. On the other hand, Mark Sanchez notably regressed last year, but ended the season between highly touted quarterbacks Philip Rivers and Mike Vick. Rivers had a poor year in general, but his track record as a prolific passer suggests he should bounce back. Vick suffered nagging injuries for much of the second half of the season. <br/><br/>The intended takeaway is to determine in which tier you think individual quarterbacks will fall in the upcoming season and draft accordingly. The rough trend from 2011 is a strong top tier of five quarterbacks, followed eight to 10 quarterbacks of steadily decreasing quality in the second tier. The third tier, with the remaining starters, has a shallower declining curve but substantially lower output. This matches up with the conventional wisdom regarding quarterbacks. Teams with a top tier QB will do anything to keep them, teams with middle tier QBs try to determine if they can take the next step, and those with a bottom tier QB are likely to look to the bench or the next draft for help.</p>
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
<p>I think Newton will regress substantially, particularly because he collected so many points from his record quarterback rushing touchdown season. Neither of his running backs (DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart) were bruisers last year, but now Carolina has added Mike Tolbert to the backfield rotation. I expect Tolbert to be on the field during goal line plays, with he and Newton splitting carries.<br/><br/>Drew Brees is also likely to decline relative to his performance last year, simply because it will be almost impossible to improve on such gaudy stats. He threw for Â 5,476 yards (NFL season record) at a 71.2 completion percentage (NFL season record) with 46 TD (4th most all-time). Combined with the Saints&#8217; offseason turmoil, coaching changes due to suspension, and defenses likely to increasingly key on Jimmy Graham, I expect Brees&#8217;s average to be closer to 25 than 30 this year.<br/><br/>I expect Vick and Rivers to ascend into the 20+ fppg (fantasy points per game) zone, as they both played far below their skill level in 2011. Matt Ryan should also push his numbers up if the Atlanta offense can make full use of Roddy White and Julio Jones. One of these three signal callers could approach the zone Cam occupied last year, with around 24 fppg.</p>
