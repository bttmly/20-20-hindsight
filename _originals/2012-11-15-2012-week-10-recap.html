<p class="body-copy">Here are the current standings (through week 10) with wins/losses and points for/against combined along with current streak. The table is sortable by variable, but in its default state it’s sorted by wins, then points for. Remember, the playoff system is different this year. Regular season ends after week 13, top six teams make the playoffs and the top two get a bye in the first round (week 14). Second round is week 15, championship is week 16. Tiebreaker for berths and seeding is total points for. </p>

   </tr></table><p class="body-copy">There’s a few notable trends. First, Jenny is in a four game slide that has seen her drop from a share of first place to barely hanging on to the last playoff spot. Luckily for her, Phil has dropped his last two and she has a significant edge in points for. Next, a week 10 loss by Hooper and wins by both Zak and myself have created a three-way tie at the top. However, Hoop has a commanding 106-point lead in PF, and in turn I’m up 72 on Zak. Finally, 11 of our 12 teams are within one game of a playoff spot. Currently two of the three 5-5 teams would make the playoffs, but there are an additional four teams at 4-6 looking for an opportunity to exploit a fuck-up.</p>

<span class="body-copy">
We have a few interesting match-ups coming up in week 11. Dave is the only team at 6-4, and he’ll be looking to pull even with Zak with a win. Two of the 5-5 bubble teams, Jenny and Phil, will be playing 4-6 climbers (Max and Pat respectively). I’ll be taking on ZM, Hoop has Ali, and Brian is up against AJ. Should be a good one, but before we start looking ahead let’s recap the week 10 matchups.
</span>

<div>
    <span class="matchup-names">ZM v. Jenny</span>
    <span class="matchup-teams">ORANGE COUNTY GUNNERS v. YOU’RE KILLING ME ELI</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">Well, Jenny hit the nail on the head with her new team name. She’s on a four-game losing streak largely thanks to the younger Manning. His points over the last three weeks: 4, 2, -1 (In fairness, Eli was the highest scoring quarterback on her roster – Mark Sanchez put up -2. In that three game stretch Eli has thrown zero TDs against four picks and has averaged under 200 yards&#8230;</p>

<p class="body-copy"><strong>Edit:</strong> this is too good to not include. I often listen to the ESPN Fantasy Focus podcast on the way to and from work (and, yes, at work). It&#8217;s consistently informative and funny, I&#8217;d recommend it. Anyway, they asked listeners to submit nicknames for Eli Manning in light of his current slump. There were a number of good ones they read today. Fantasy General Akbar (or just Fantasy Akbar) – &#8220;It&#8217;s a trap!&#8221; or Fantasy Mrs. Robinson – will seduce you and ruin your life. The best, and certainly the most accurate, was this gem:</p>
<blockquote><div>"Eli manning is the fantasy frozen burrito. Hot in spots, cold in others, never as good as you remembered, you end up getting burned at some point, has a hall of fame big brother–the restaurant burrito, and regardless of how long they&#8217;ve been in your freezer because you know sooner or later, you&#8217;re gonna eat one."</div></blockquote>

<p class="body-copy">Simply amazing. Anyway, they picked Fantasy Akbar as the nickname since a.) it sounds funnier and b.) as you may have heard, Disney, which owns ESPN, recently acquired Lucasfilms so they may have access to the &#8220;it&#8217;s a trap&#8221; audio drop. Decent reasoning, but in my mind Eli will forever be the Frozen Burrito. (They did agree to name Peyton the Restaurant Burrito, however.)</p>

<p class="body-copy">&#8230;. Anyway, Eli&#8230; Ouch. Still, this matchup was winnable on paper even with Eli’s struggles but things didn’t quite work out as expected. After getting absolutely shredded by Doug Martin last week the Oakland run stopping unit was able to hold Rice, a far superior back, to just 12 FP. Isaac Redman, who piled up 20 FP last week, was held to a donut. He was featured early but Jonathan Dwyer took over after Redman lost fumble. Jeremy Maclin has been all over the place this year, and while he posted his third 15+ FP day of the season this week, Jenny’s other receivers were disappointing. The Falcons’ questionable pass defense held Marques Colston to just three catches (one for a touchdown – 8 FP), and Miles Austin only reeled in two balls against the listless Eagles (3 FP). The Ravens D/ST was predictably stellar as Baltimore walloped Oakland 55-20, but Jenny still came up short. Jenny’s team will continue to struggle until Eli gets back on track. The Giants are on bye this week, so maybe he regains his composure and finishes strong. Maybe. She finally hit the free agent market hard last night with three add/drops (she had a total of three on the season previously) and will be starting Ryan Fitzpatrick at QB next week in her crucial matchup with Max.</p>
<p class="body-copy">ZM’s team has been among the least productive this year. He scored 77 this week and actually <em>improved</em> his average points per game. Yikes. I’m shocked he won this one. First, starting the Patriots D/ST over the Bucs’? The Bills weren’t going to win this one no matter what, but they can score. Tampa Bay is on a tear and their defense has been opportunistic lately. Against the flaming wreckage that is 2012 Philip Rivers? Yes, yes <em>please</em>. Well, ZM overcame that mistake anyway and he has Danny Woodhead to thank. He finaly wised up to the fact that you shouldn’t be starting either Carolina running back (he has both) and put in Woodhead, who had no double digit games on the season. I can’t believe the Pats don’t use him more – he’s a shifty dude. He caught four balls for 46 yards and a score and rushed once for 15 yards and another score (17 FP) after avergaging just over five FPPG previously. Cam Newton threw two picks but didn’t utterly shit the bed (15 FP) and LeSean McCoy had 20 total touches for 10 FP. McCoy’s inability to get into the end zone on a consistent basis (5 total TD this season) is a problem, but he did just enough to push ZM to victory this week. The rest of the roster was mediocre or worse, with Denver kicker Matt Prater as the only other double-digit scorer. ZM is somehow 4-6 now.</p>
<p class="scoreboard">ZM 77 (4-6); Jenny 72 (5-5)</p>
<hr class="style-eight"><div>
    <span class="matchup-names">Pat v. Hooper</span>
    <span class="matchup-teams">TOWN TAXES v. THE WHOLE WORLD IS A COUCH</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">I think we can all agree Hoop’s team looks like the championship favorite right now. He put up 120 with Rodgers on bye and his backup QB playing less than half a game. Adrian Peterson keeps giving everyone that passed on him in the second round heartburn (i.e. everyone). His point totals the past four weeks (this week’s game last): 21, 15, 31, 25. Ridiculous. And the MVP chatter around him is rising. He is on bye next week, and after that has a five-game stretch to close out the fantasy season that includes Chicago twice and Houston once, which could be rough going. But then again he exposed a supposedly stout Seattle defense, so maybe not. Jimmy Graham racked up 26 FP on seven catches, 147 yards and two scores. Another measure of how strong this squad is: Frank Gore in the flex with 16 FP! The Texans D/ST was productive in their mud wrestling match with the Bears, allowing just 6 points and recording four takeaways, while also knocking Jay Cutler out of the game. But these strong performances couldn’t paper over two major holes. First, Alex Smith. He’s an acceptable bye week fill-in but he’s been erratic in fantasy production – three 20+ games, three single-digit games including one with negative points. It doesn’t help when he gets his bell rung (twice) and can’t finish the first half. Second, big problems at wide receiver. Hoop is strong everywhere except WR and it shows up when his other studs aren’t playing. Kenny Britt and Antonio Brown have been busts, and Danny Amendola can’t carry the load by himself with a tough schedule coming up. If Hoop can get past AP’s bye in good shape he’ll be set up for a deep playoff run, but those receivers will continue to be a liability that could hurt him if Rodgers, AP, or Graham has an off day.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Pat put up some big numbers this week, and needed almost all of them to get the W. The obvious star was Joe Flacco, who proved yet again that playing the Raiders can rejuvenate any offensive player. Flacco was excellent (34 FP on 341 yds., 4 total TD, 1 INT) as the Ravens annihilated the Raiders. Marshawn Lynch piled up 17 FP, although he did lose a fumble for the first time this season, and Roddy White hauled in seven balls for 114 yards (11 FP). But it was Tony Gonzalez and Calvin Johnson who really put this one away. Megatron amassed 23 FP on 12 catches, 207 yards, a touchdown, and a fumble, making it his best day of the season so far. Tony Gonzalez did him one better, notching 24 FP on 11 grabs for 122 yards and a pair of scores. Those touchdowns were the 100th and 101st of his career – simply incredible. The only disappointment was Jonathan Dwyer, who only gained 56 yards on his 19 carries despite playing the Chiefs. Dwayne Bowe can’t qualify as a disappointment because Matt Cassel sets the bar so low.</p>
<p class="scoreboard">Pat 133 (4-6); Hooper 120 (7-3)</p>
<hr class="style-eight"><div>
    <span class="matchup-names">Nick v. Phil</span>
    <span class="matchup-teams">CHARLIE’S $150 DICK RASH v. THE BAUCE OF SAUCE</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">Sure, everyone throws on the Saints, but goddamn Matty Ice has been a stud this season. He put up 31 this week, raising his season average to 23.6 and tying Brady for third best at the position. He’s also been remarkably consistent, with just two games under 20 FP (most notably a seven-point head-scratcher against Oakland). Arian Foster has been a workhorse as well. While many have voiced concern about the number of touches he’s getting, I couldn’t be happier from a fantasy standpoint. His season <em>low</em> is 14 FP and he’s found the end zone in every game, with three multi-score games thrown in. He also has yet to lose a fumble this season. His 17-point outing against the Bears was far more impressive than Ryan’s 31 against New Orleans. Aside from those two, I fell ass-backwards into an 18 FP, 2 TD performance from Torrey Smith. I also got 25 from the kicker and D/ST slots combined. Aside from that things were mediocre or worse, but it worked out fine. Zak clued me in to an interesting fact this week: at one point or another this season I&#8217;ve owned (and subsequently dropped) the tight ends who are currently 2nd, 7th, 8th, 9th, 11th, 12th, and 16th at the position. Those are Heath Miller, Jason Witten, Martellus Bennett, Kyle Rudolph, Jermaine Gresham, Scott Chandler, and Dennis Pitta. My current guy, Dwayne Allen, is 21st (numbers prior to week 10 I believe). Do not listen to my advice, ever.</p>
<p class="body-copy">First, credit where credit is due: Steven Jackson somehow managed 18 FP against the Niners. I watched the game, and I still don’t understand how that happened. Admittedly, he did get 29 carries. But still, props I guess. Besides Jackson, Tom Brady was Phil’s only other double-digit scorer and only one of the remaining seven guys exceeded five FP. Yeah, pretty brutal. With a 5-5 record and Tom Brady on his roster Phil could still make the playoffs. Getting Randall Cobb back next week will be a relief, but it will be a tough final few weeks unless Aaron Hernandez comes back at something resembling 100%. His substantial deficit in total points (third fewest) might cost him a tiebreaker down the road though.</p>
<p class="scoreboard">Nick 115 (7-3); Phil 69 (5-5)</p>
<hr class="style-eight"><div>
    <span class="matchup-names">Zak v. Ali</span>
    <span class="matchup-teams">BREES CAN’T SING BUT HE CAN BALL v. CHOMO SE DICE: SALSA CON QUESO</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">Yes indeed, Brees can ball. While 26 FP against the questionable Atlanta defense isn’t stellar, it got the job done. Chris Johnson has been on a tear since Zak acquired him from Max, albeit with some well-timed luck. In week 10 he ran for 126 yards and a score on 23 carries (5.5 avg.) against a Dolphins defense that is among the best run-stopping units in the league. Even after the Tennessee game they’re only allowing 3.8 YPC. I still don’t trust Chris Johnson but his numbers these past few weeks speak for themselves. There are other things to note here. First, the re-emergence of Kyle Rudolph (12 FP), whom many had left for dead. Second, the widely-expected erosion of Michael Turner, who gained just 15 yards on 13 carries against a defense allowing 5.1 YPC. <em>Three</em> of Turner’s carries were inside the Saints’ 2-yard line. On the season Turner is third in the NFL on carries inside the opponent’s 5 (12, behind McGahee, 13, and Foster, 22) yet has scored just twice on those runs. For comparison, starting running backs generally convert roughly a third to a half of such carries. Turner’s speed has been gone for a while; now it looks like his power is declining as well. Zak has a few back-up RBs, and is in great position on the win-loss chart, but with the playoffs on the horizon Turner’s output bears watching.</p>
<p class="body-copy">With Jenny and Phil both losing, Ali had a chance to move out of the clusterfuck at 5-5 and gain some breathing room in the playoff race. Unfortunately for him, things just didn’t break his way. First, the ongoing injury issues with his running backs are really holding the team back. While Jamaal Charles did get back on track after a few consecutive lackluster performances, a combination of injuries and byes forced Ali to start Joique Bell at RB2. Bell did great week nine against the Jags… because the Lions let him carry the ball. This time around Bell ran only once, although he did catch 7 balls for 44 yards. Peyton was also a little disappointing with just 15 FP (301 yds., 1 TD, 1 FUML) after five straight weeks of 3 TD and 23+ FP. Though the Broncos trounced the Panthers the D/ST accounted for two touchdowns and a safety. Let’s keep the disappointment express rolling, shall we? Victor Cruz’s fate is in Eli’s hands, and Eli has been terrible lately. Cruz has just 10 FP combined in his last three games. Next up, Vernon Davis. While Cruz’s fantasy swoon has an easy explanation, Davis’s decidely does not. He’s on the field nearly every snap and gets open but Smith just doesn’t throw him the ball. Davis has 41 targets in 2012 (4.5 per game), on pace for a meager 72 for the season. If that number holds up it would represent a 25% drop from last season’s target total (95). Perhaps the maturation of Michael Crabtree has encouraged the Niners to go to him; whatever the cause, it’s a disaster for Ali. Things might improve soon, however. We have no clue how long MJD will be out but it looks like Darren Sproles should be back soon.</p>
<p class="scoreboard">Zak 114 (7-3); Ali 96 (5-5)</p>
<hr class="style-eight"><div>
    <span class="matchup-names">Dave v. AJ</span>
    <span class="matchup-teams">THAT’S NO MOON v. NO WORK TODAY</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">I can’t believe Dave started Andre Brown, Jeremy Kerley, and Justin Blackmon and still rolled up 102 FP. The timing of his massive bye week (four probable starters) couldn’t have worked out better. Kerley and Blackmon were awful (two FP each), but Andre Brown was a nice surprise with 14 FP. While it seems the Giants still belive Ahmad Bradshaw is their best back, they made a concerted effort to spread the load and reduce the chances of a setback for Bradshaw going into a much-needed bye week. Brown made the most of it, taking his seven carries for 67 yards and a score while also catching five balls for 29 yards. Elsewhere, Stevan Ridley ran roughshod over the league-worst (yes, below the Saints) Buffalo run defense. In addition to Matt Stafford’s monster game in Minnesota, that was enough to seal it. There are some more things to keep an eye on though. Antonio Gates is starting to come on a bit, with four TDs in his last four games. Also, Dave is entering the toughest part of his schedule with games against Zak (7-3) and Hoop (7-3) in the next two weeks before finishing against Phil (5-5). But he’ll be working with a full deck now that the bye is out of the way, including Trent Richardson, Larry Fitz, Jordy Nelson, and RG3, and could cause some damage in the playoff standings down the stretch. Oh, and he still has the Bears D/ST who have some favorable matchups over that stretch. Watch out.</p>
<p class="body-copy">It’s hard to imagine a more hapless fantasy squad than AJ’s. Injuries and bad luck have wrecked his squad since the start of the season. Remember when Fred Jackson went down in week one? Well speaking of F-Jax, he went off for 20 FP in week 10 – on the bench – then suffered a nasty concussion on the last play of the game. Yep, with AJ’s luck this year that sounds about right. Shall we go on? First round pick DeMarco Murray: no timetable for return from a foot injury. His second rounder was Fred Jackson. His third and fourth rounders, Brandon Lloyd and BenJarvus Green-Ellis are healthy but unproductive. He dropped his fifth pick, Jermichael Finley, entirely. Sixth pick Percy Harvin? Out with a bum ankle. His trade for Michael Vick (obviously) hasn’t panned out, and Vick suffered a concussion of his own this week. AJ’s top scorer in week 10 was <em>Felix Jones</em>, followed by Scott Chandler and Malcolm Floyd.</p>
<p class="scoreboard">Dave 104 (6-4); AJ 65 (2-8)</p>
<hr class="style-eight"><div>
    <span class="matchup-names">Max v. Brian</span>
    <span class="matchup-teams">WE GOT NICKS LIKE JESUS v. FUCK YOU AARON SORKIN</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p class="body-copy">Max’s team is excellent on paper, but has no depth. Week 10 showed what his team can do when (almost) all his starters show up and play. That “almost” is thanks to Reggie Bush (-1 FP) and Matt Forte (3 FP). Bush is on something of a short leash these days with two fumbles lost in the last three games, but I can’t put this one entirely on him. The Dolphins were just terrible on Sunday. As for Forte, I’d chalk it up to a combination of the opposing defense (excellent), the weather (awful), and a QB change that allowed Houston to key in on the run. The centerpiece of Max’s team are the stud receivers, AJ Green and Brandon Marshall. In fact, they’re #1 and #2 among fantasy WRs respectively. I was listening to the ESPN Fantasy Underground podcast this morning and they noted a statistic I thought was interesting: the Bears have the widest disparity in yards between their first and second most productive receivers. Marshall has 904 yards on the season, a ridiculous 717 more than the next guy (Earl Bennet). To look at it another way, Marshall has 483% more yards than the second place guy. I think this is an interesting metric, so I ran it for every team in the league. Megatron is second (557-yard differential, 234%), with Dwayne Bowe, Cecil Shorts, and Percy Harvin rounding out the top five by percentage. I usually like looking at proportional figures, but pure yards are most important to fantasy. The top five in absolute yard differential are Marshall, Megatron, Reggie Wayne, AJ Green and Percy Harvin. I might dig in to these numbers mroe later, but they paint a pretty clear picture of which teams have basically a single option at receiver. One final thing to note is that the teams at the top and bottom of the list tend to be better than those in the middle. These are basically the teams that have a truly elite receiver, or are able to spread it around to a number of competent targets. The teams in middle generally rely on a guy whose talent doesn’t really justify the workload. If you’re interested, <strong><a href="http://20-20hindsight.tumblr.com/two-receiver-comparison">here’s the chart</a></strong>. Oh, I was supposed to be writing a recap, sorry. Let’s see… the Panthers finally gave Greg Olsen substantial targets and he was excellent, reeling in nine balls for 102 yards and two touchdowns, and was the only Panther to find the end zone. Dez Bryant had a nice outing as well (14 FP) but continues to be unreliable – he scored exactly 1 FP in two of the last four weeks. Finally, the Broncos D/ST did a Bears impression against the Panthers, racking up 30 FP behind a pick-six and a punt return TD. 
</p><p class="body-copy">Brian’s team is… not great. And they had a shitty outing this week. And injuries continue to be a problem. But of the three 4-6 teams I think he has the best shot to – actually never mind, I just checked the schedule. He has Zak and Hoop back-to-back to close out the regular season. He won’t win both (unless Hoop decides to rest his starters before the playoffs…) so 6-7 is likely the best case scenario. Also, I just talked about how strong Max’s team could be. Damn. Well while Brian may not make the playoffs, his team should improve over the next three weeks for a few reasons. The injury to Big Ben will expedite the long-overdue move to Josh Freeman. The Tampa offense humming right now and Brian needs to strike while the iron’s hot – the Bucs’ next three matchups are all decent or better matchups for the passing game. Next, Eric Decker (and the entire Denver offense) will step it up and try to put the division title away as early as possible. In addition, CJ Spiller will get the whole load while F-Jax deals with his concussion, and Ahmad Bradshaw should come back healthier after a light load followed by a bye week. You gotta love an underdog! Plus, I’ll be rooting for Brian for my own motives – remember, only the top two seeds get a first round bye.</p>
<p class="scoreboard">Max 119 (4-6); Brian 66 (4-6)</p>
