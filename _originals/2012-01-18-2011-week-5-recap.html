<p><span>Five  weeks in and the quality of the teams in the league is becoming fully  apparent. There are two teams at 5-0 and two at 4-1. These teams are  good. Sure, they have off weeks where they score below 100 but the key  thing is that their draft picks panned out. They are relying on and  getting most of their production from the guys they picked up in the  draft. Of course they&#8217;re still looking for free agent bargains, if only  to keep them away from rivals. These four teams have averaged 111.85  points per game so far this season. Then there are the four 2-3 teams.  These teams are either still holding on to hope that their high draft  picks will get healthy or begin producing, or are else wildly ransacking  fantasy football blogs for obscure free agent advice. These teams  averaged 86.15. Finally there are four teams at 1-4, although the  numbers might not be what you would expect. The 1-4 teams averaged 89.65  – 3.5 points per game higher than the 2-3s. So the 1-4 teams are  actually a little better, and unluckier than the 2-3s. But both groups  are pretty close to each other… and far, far from the four at the top.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>LINC  75 (2-3); DEM 54 (2-3)</span></strong><br/><span>After  sneaking past Zak last week with a two point margin of victory despite a  slew of mediocre performances, reality set in week 5: I put up a dismal  54 total points. Sure, I could blame this on bye weeks (I had 5 guys  sitting) or injuries (Andre Johnson!), but its actually just plain bad  players. In fact, if Marshawn Lynch had scored his average from weeks  1-4 I would have only scored 44! You know things are bad when Lynch is  your only player in double digits. Matt Ryan stunk it up versus the  extremely porous Green Bay pass defense. In fact, here were the numbers  the Packers let opposing quarterbacks post during the first four weeks:  34 (Brees), 28 (Newton), 21 (Cutler), 22 (ORTON!?) and then they held my  boy to a measly EIGHT! On top of that, Ryan&#8217;s favorite target over the  past two weeks, and my go-to flex, Julio Jones, suffered a,  yep-you-guessed-it, hamstring injury! (whew that was a lot of comas.)  Oh, and DeAngelo Williams picked his first week on the bench to start  doing well: 115 yards and a score on just 9 carries! With this awful  performance, my team slipped in to last place in Total Points For on the  season with a total of 385 (77 pts/game). Meanwhile, Jenny&#8217;s team had a  solid outing, especially the top half of her roster. Schaub threw for  416, 2 TDs and 2 picks (24 fantasy pts). She has a couple of things to  keep an eye on going forward, however: Willis McGahee&#8217;s numbers are  likely to slip somewhat with Tebow under center, and LeGarrette Blount&#8217;s  knee injury will likely hold him out at least a week. On the other  hand, Julio Jones&#8217; injury means Matty Ice will have to rely on Roddy  White more than he has been. Plus, she should get Lee Evans back at some  point. By the way, I hear Jenny might be trying to trade Rashad  Jennings, so hit her up if you&#8217;re interested.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>WILL  112 (5-0); TUSK 108 (4-1)</span></strong><br/><span>In  a showdown of unbeatens, Dave narrowly escaped with the win. Rodgers  and Brees were both excellent as usual, each throwing for more than 350  yards and two TDs (although Brees did throw a pick). Dave made the odd  choice to start two Chargers running backs, Ryan Mathews and Mike  Tolbert, who combined for 16 points. The explosive but inconsistent  DeSean Jackson added 14 more, while Vernon Davis and kicker Mason Crosby  each tacked on 15. Phil had trouble at both WR and RB, netting 9 points  from four players at those positions. Looks like Vincent Jackson is  actually pretty banged up. However, Dwayne Bowe made up for it by piling  up 128 yards and a pair of scores. Still that&#8217;s an average of  6.6pts/player for WR/RB spots, a big crater in the heart of the roster  (err&#8230; not that I have any room to talk). The bottom of the roster made  up for it though: the insanely hot Jimmy Graham didn&#8217;t find the end  zone but did rack up 129 yards. And then get this: defense and kicker  combining for &lt;b&gt;39&lt;/b&gt; points! Fucking ridiculous. The  Niners defense was phenomenal this week, holding the Bucs to a field  goal while picking up three turnovers and a score. Kicker Nick Novak was  5/5 on field goals, with four from 40+ and one from 50+. He also hit  both PATs. It still wasn&#8217;t enough to spoil Dave&#8217;s perfect record. Still,  Phil&#8217;s team might be better than Dave&#8217;s, despite the final score. He  was missing his best player, Ray Rice, who would almost certainly have  given him the W.</span></p>
<p><br/><strong><span>BREH  84 (4-1); ZAK 84 (1-4)</span></strong><br/><span>Tom  Brady couldn&#8217;t break 20 this week (even though the Pats won), so you  know that&#8217;s bad news for Zak. Brady contributed less than 20% of Zak&#8217;s  total points, where he has been averaging near a third. In fact, Brady  has steadily declined every week! (42, 43,31, 21, 16) But realistically,  expect Brady&#8217;s numbers to bounce back a bit as teams are forced to  respect the New England run game more and more. Meanwhile, Vick had  another strong week even as the Eagles continued their slide. He ran for  90 while throwing for 315 and 2 TD. However, he also threw FOUR  interceptions, bringing his total to seven INTs over five games. Wes  Welker (1st WR in player rank) and Calvin Johnson (2nd) contributed 31  together. Welker is averaging 20.6/game and Calvin Johnson is getting  19.2. The next WR, Steve Smith, is behind by a big margin (14.8/game).  Welker now has 740 yards in 5 games, putting him on pace for over 2,300  rec yds for the season. Even if you removed his 217 yard anomaly, he&#8217;d  be averaging about 131 yards a game, for a season pace of nearly 2,100.  The guy is simply unstoppable right now. Now let&#8217;s talk Megatron.  Stafford looked a little overeager early in the game, and in particular,  overthrew CJ on an almost sure-thing touchdown. Unfortunately,  Johnson&#8217;s 4 game 2TD streak ended Monday night, leaving him in a tie for  most consecutive 2+ rec TD games. The bottom half of Pat&#8217;s lineup is  definitely his weak spot and is what caused this game to be so close.  Rob Gronkowski has cooled off significantly, averaging just 2 over the  past two weeks. (He had almost 19/wk through week 3.) The Titan defense  was surprisingly soft, letting Big Ben throw 5 TD. And Atlanta&#8217;s Matt  Bryant never even got to kick a field goal, as the Falcons were held to  five consecutive punts after their opening two scoring drives. Still  though, a W is a W. Zak struggled with Sidney Rice&#8217;s first single digit  game since becoming a factor in week 3. He is also dealing with some  (how do you say envy in French?) of Pierre Garcon, who has become the  new favorite target in Indy. Garcon had two TD in each of the last two  weeks, while Wayne had eight catches, no scores and 136 yds total. His  RBs looked solid though, with MJD putting up 14 and Ingram a respectable  10. This is a tough loss to swallow, with a two-week total margin of  just -3 and 0-2 to show for it.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>MARC  106 (1-4); MS 81 (2-3)</span></strong><br/><span>With  his first win of the season, Jordan finally climbed out of the cellar  and joined three others in the 1-4 basement. With a 25 point win over AJ  and a team that looks much better than 1-4, Jordan may be poised for a  surge. But there may be a couple points of vague worry here as well.  Philip Rivers has been a bit underwhelming (though largely consistent)  this season: his high through five games is 22, and those opponents  include the 1st (Denver), 2nd (Miami), and 4th (New England) worst teams  versus the quarterback. He&#8217;s also averaging only 1.2 passing TD/game. I  would put this largely on the emaciated receiving corps, with Antonio  Gates out for who-knows how long and Vincent Jackson all kinds of banged  up. Listen to this: his average is 17.4/game (14th in the league), just  ahead of Jason Campbell (17.0) and Alex Smith (16.8), and behind Colt  McCoy (17.8). Then go compare him to the other second round QBs: Brady,  Brees and Stafford. Worse for Jordan, the Cardinals&#8217; offensive struggles  are having a direct effect on Larry Fitzgerald, who was back in single  digits for the first time since week 1. Other holes include the Chargers  D/ST and Marcedes Lewis. However Adrian Peterson is carrying the load,  with 30 last week. Meanwhile, the Law Firm put rookie Stevan Ridley back  in his place; he got nearly the entire workload, ran for 136 and found  the end zone twice. Oh, and Steve Smith is the third best fantasy WR in  the league at this point. On the other side of the match, AJ&#8217;s team was  all over the place. Cam Newton did well while losing yet again (26 pts).  Jahvid Best torched the Bears to the tune of 163 yards and a score on  just TWELVE carries. Steve Breaston caught four passes for 50 yards and  two scores. However, Joseph Addai got a measly one point and Mike  Williams had a donut. And Mike Williams got off easy; the Niners  wholesale destruction of the Bucs put the Tampa Bay D/ST at -5 for the  week.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>TWS  117 (5-0); HUH? 93(1-4)</span></strong><br/><span>After  finally benching the so-far sloppy Ben Roethlisberger, Ali got burned  terribly on Sunday. Pittsburgh was going up against a fairly robust  Tennessee defense that had yet to allow an opposing QB to break 20. Yet a  gimpy Big Ben with a paper thin O line managed to toss 5 TDs for 37  fantasy points. (If he had played Big Ben over Hasselbeck, he would  still have come up one point short – 116-117.) Ali also had Deion Branch  on the bench with 13. Yet some of his other players did remarkably  well, and his team as a whole did better than it has over the past few  weeks. Fred Jackson has been absolutely on fire this season, going for  25 in week 5. Malcolm Floyd benefitted from a hurt V-Jax and an inactive  Antonio Gates. On Max&#8217;s side, Arian Foster had a rather pedestrian  rushing day, but caught 5 passes for a whopping 116 receiving yards  while Matt Forte gained over 150 total yards. But neither one found the  end zone, and Darren McFadden finished with just 6. AJ Green looked very  solid, posting 90 yards and a score in Cincinnati&#8217;s win over the  miserable Jags. The standout for TWS was Eli Manning, who piled up 26  points on 3 TD and 420 yds passing despite 3 picks and a lost fumble.  The second highest scorer was Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski who  booted three 50+ yard field goals, a 40+ and a PAT for 20 total. He also  put up monster numbers in our multi-sport fantasy dip league, powering  through three cans during the Raiders nailbiter win over the Texans. He  was the only non-baseball player drafted in the first round.</span><br/><span></span><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>JUIC  85 (2-3); SPAU 74 (1-4)</span></strong><br/><span>ZM,  apparently on autopilot, narrowly lost the Donut Cup to Andre this  week. With two goose eggs and a quarterback posting 4, I can&#8217;t believe  he still scored 85 points. Looking at this team right now, its actually  fairly strong but has some notable weaknesses. First, QB. Kolb has nine  points over the past two weeks combined; he shouldn&#8217;t be considered a  fantasy starter at this point. Second, Dallas Clark is just not good  without Peyton and needs to sit. And third, the Patriots defense is BAD.  But on the plus side, Greg Jennings has been remarkably consistent,  especially for a wideout in Green Bay, getting in to double digits every  week so far. Of course he&#8217;s Rodgers&#8217; favorite, but still. Beanie Wells  has been solid in every game he&#8217;s started, as has LeSean McCoy. But the  true reason ZM won this game is that he started Pierre Garcon, who has 2  TD and 125+ in each of the last two games. He is now obviously Curtis  Painter&#8217;s favorite, simply because he makes him look good. Andre&#8217;s team  struggled with low production. Stafford posted his lowest total yet, 18,  while Chris Johnson suffered some regression in the number of carries  he got, and totaled 12. But what sunk Andre this week, without a doubt,  were the three donuts he accumulated from Eric Decker, Rashard  Mendenhall and Dustin Keller. Let&#8217;s see&#8230; Keller has been ineffective  this season, Decker had chemistry with Orton but he&#8217;s been benched and  Mendenhall was hurt. Time to hit the free agent or trade market. Andre  will be receiving the coveted Donut Award this week for his three secret  agent double-O zeroes.</span></p>
