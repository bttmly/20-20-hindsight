<p>This is mostly paraphrased from <a href="http://espn.go.com/fantasy/blog/_/name/bell_stephania/id/8433803/">Stephania Bell</a>.</p>
<p>Looks like <strong>Matt Stafford</strong> will play although it&#8217;s really not clear exactly what his injury is and if/how it will affect his performance. The Lions have the Vikings at home and I have no idea what to think about this game. Actually, maybe nobody knows what to think about this game – <a href="http://20-20hindsight.tumblr.com/2012/09/28/2012week4lines.html">somehow it isn&#8217;t on the week 4 betting sheet</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Ahmad Bradshaw</strong> looks like he&#8217;s coming back this weekend. Here&#8217;s some faulty logic courtesy of Ms. Bell: &#8220;Those who make their living at a computer are at as much, if not more, risk than professional football players for developing disc problems in their neck and back. So if everyone on a laptop is going to continue to work, Bradshaw can too. If Bradshaw&#8217;s neck does turn into a recurring problem then his status may change, but until that time, he can be expected to play.&#8221; Uhmmm&#8230; alright? So if I&#8217;m at the same risk of developinga disc problem as a football player, does that necessarily mean the disc problem would likely be of the same severity? Or would one think that a bulging disc suffered from a brutal, neck compressing hit might be a little worse? Also, the marginal likelihood of re-injury from returning to a single day of work: higher at a desk or on the field in the NFL?</p>
<p>Uncertainty abounds in the Buffalo backfield. <strong>CJ Spiller</strong> and<strong> Fred Jackson</strong> are both recovering faster than expected, but it&#8217;s unclear if either will play. Jackson seems more likely to go, although it&#8217;s doubtful he&#8217;d get anywhere near a full workload. Third stringer <strong>Tashard Choice </strong>will be in the mix as well.</p>
<p>Steven Jacksonis old, can&#8217;t run it very well anymore, and his groin hurts. He&#8217;ll probably be on the field Sunday but if you can avoid starting him, do so. They&#8217;ve been working in their two rookie backs, <strong>Isaiah Pead</strong> and <strong>Daryl Richardson</strong> in practice this week. They took Pead in the second round in the 2012 draft, and Richardson was the next-to-last pick of the entire draft, but Richardson has been more impressive so far.</p>
<p>Things look promising for <strong>Matt Forte</strong> to return Monday night. Max should be extremely happy he handcuffed Forte and<strong> <strong>Michael Bush</strong></strong> as he can adjust accordingly once things are more clear later this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Reggie Bush</strong>, <strong>Willis McGahee</strong>, and <strong>LeSean McCoy</strong> all got a little banged up last week but all are expected to take the field on Sunday.</p>
<p>Well, it didn&#8217;t take <strong>Beanie Wells</strong> long to end up on IR (actually, the NFL has a new thing this season &#8220;Injured Reserve–Designated to Return&#8221; which means he could actually come back after week 12).<strong>Ryan Williams</strong> will carry the load for the time being although he has had some ball-security issues, with a fumble lost in each of his first two games. If he can hang on to the rock he&#8217;ll be in line for a steady workload; if not, Arizona may have to go looking for someone who can.</p>
<p><strong>Pierre Garçon</strong> will likely miss another week with his nagging foot injury.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty much it for the marquee guys in week 4. <strong>Steelers</strong> and <strong>Colts</strong> are on bye so get them out of your lineup unless you want to look for another league next year.</p>
