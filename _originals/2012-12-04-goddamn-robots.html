<a href="http://automatedinsights.com/fantasy_recap">Goddamn Robots.</a><br/><p>This company makes a program that writes&#8230; <a href="http://automatedinsights.com/fantasy_recap">fantasy recaps</a>. No, seriously. Well&#8230; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=768h3Tz4Qik">this about sums it up</a>. My writing might be a little better (<em>might be</em>), but that thing is kicking my ass in the automated graphs department. Those are cool as shit.</p>
