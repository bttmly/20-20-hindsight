<p><div class="intro">
    <p class="body-copy">With just one week to go, nine teams are still (technically) alive for six playoff spots. Let&#8217;s start at the lower seeds and work up. Tiebreakers are likely going to figure into the final seedings in a major way, and I&#8217;m going to assume that a margin of 60 total is safe. In other words, if Person A is currently 60+ ahead of Person B, their lead is safe in case those teams end up with the same record. It&#8217;s possible to overcome a deficit of this magnitude but highly unlikely.</p>

Jenny secures a playoff spot with a win as she holds a commanding 119-point lead over ZM. Further, Dave and Phil (both 7-5) are playing each other this week so one of them will be 7-6 when all is said and done. Jenny is up 51 on Phil so if she wins and Phil loses she&#8217;ll likely jump to the fifth seed. If ZM wins and Jenny loses he&#8217;ll lock up a spot. However, things get really interesting if both ZM and Jenny lose. In that case, the highest scoring team with six wins will sneak in. This means Ali and Max are both still alive, although they&#8217;re on life support. Step one is for them to win their matchups this week. Jenny would still have the advantage in that case, as she leads in scoring among the 6-6 and 5-7 teams. But her margin is not unassailable – she&#8217;s up 27 on Max and 38 on Ali. Keep an eye on this one.</p>
    
    <p class="body-copy">Not a whole lot is on the line for the Dave-Phil matchup. They&#8217;re both guaranteed to make it, but neither can get one of the byes. As mentioned above, if Phil loses and Jenny wins, Phil will probably wind up as the sixth seed. But even if both Hoop and I both lose and Dave wins, Hoop&#8217;s huge lead in total points will guarantee him the second bye. Dave and I would then have a narrow tiebreaker to determine third and fourth seeds – we&#8217;re currently separated by just eight points.</p>
    
    <p class="body-copy">As with the bottom, things are still in flux at the top. Zak has a one game lead on Hoop and I, but is also substantially behind both of us in total points – 62 back of me, 156 back of Hoop. If Zak wins and moves to 10-3 he&#8217;s guaranteed the top seed and a first round bye. If he loses, but one of Hoop or I lose also, he&#8217;ll have the 2-seed. But if he loses and both Hoop and I win, we will probably grab the top two spots and the byes on tiebreakers, with Zak at the third seed. This would likely mean he would go against Jenny in back-to-back weeks since #3 will play #6 in the first round.</p>
    
    <p class="body-copy">Although Pat, Brian, and AJ are all out of the hunt they could still act as spoilers. Pat (versus Ali) and AJ (versus ZM) could each crush the dreams of a playoff hopeful. Brian hopes to exact a little roommate revenge by denying Hoop a first round bye and making his playoff road tougher.</p>
    
    <p class="body-copy">Good luck folks! Actually, screw you guys, except Brian and Jenny.</p>
