	Only one game had any playoff implications this week, so that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to cover. To recap the playoff situation going into this week:<br/><br/>- Dave had the lead (on the last playoff spot) with a 7-5 record<br/>- Ali was a game behind at 6-6<br/>- Andre and myself were half a game behind Ali at 5-6-1<br/><!-- more --><br/>Here&#8217;s how each could have made the playoffs:<br/><br/>DAVE:<br/>Dave had to beat Ali â€“ or if he lost he would have to win in week 14 and Ali would have to lose.<br/><br/>ALI:<br/>Ali had narrowly beaten Dave in week 7, so if he beat Dave a second time he would own the tiebreaker. If Ali won, both of them would be 7-6 going into week 14. Then, if Ali won, or if he and Dave BOTH lost Ali would get the 4th seed in the playoffs. If Dave won and Ali lost then Dave would get the playoff spot.<br/><br/>NICK/ANDRE<br/>For either of us to make it, Ali had to beat Dave in week 13, sending them both to 7-6. We were playing each other in week 13 so whoever won would be 6-6-1. With Ali and Dave both at 7-6, they would both have to lose in week 14, and the winner of me and Andre&#8217;s week 13 matchup would have to win in week 14. That person would then be 7-6-1 and would win the last spot by a .5 game margin over the Dave and Ali (both 7-7). <br/><br/><strong>WILL 94 (8-5); HUH? 62 (6-7)</strong><br/>Oddly enough, this is the first time I can remember that ESPN&#8217;s game line was right on the money; the projection was Dave to win by 32. Aaron Rodgers led the way with a 39-point outing, as he&#8217;s been doing for Dave all season. The rest of Dave&#8217;s team was mediocre with the exception of Ryan Mathews, who looks like he&#8217;s coming back strong from a midseason slump. Mathews hit double digits in each of the first five weeks, but his production dropped off along with that of the Chargers. He broke 5 points just one time in the five games following the bye. Luckily for Ali, there wasn&#8217;t really anything he could have done differently to win this one. The biggest problem was at quarterback. Since I needed him to win to keep my own playoff hopes alive, I discussed his QB situation with him for a while and finally persuaded him that Hasselbeck was the one. The Bills, now 21st against QBs were definitely ranked lower before holding Hasselbeck to 5. Carson Palmer sat on the bench with 20, but that 15 point difference wouldn&#8217;t have changed the outcome. Also disappointing was DeAngelo Williams who quickly receded into the background of the Carolina offense after his big day last week. He had just 29 yards on 11 carries.<br/><br/>Anyway, the seeding for the playoffs is still up in the air with one game to go. Max has clinched first, but Phil is just one game up on Pat, who is a game ahead of Dave. I&#8217;m not going to look at the tiebreakers right now, but honestly I don&#8217;t think Dave or Pat can beat either Phil or Max. <br/><br/>Next week I&#8217;ll go over the final seeding and a playoff preview, including who is vulnerable to injuries and unfavorable matchups. Good luck fellas.</p>
