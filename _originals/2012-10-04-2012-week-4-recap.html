<p>After the week 3 upheaval things settled down considerably in week 4. The real refs returned to work, squelching the biggest storyline from the week before. For the most part good teams handled business against bad teams. <!-- more --> The Falcons nearly lost their unblemished mark to the Panthers, but were handed a gift when Carolina head coach Ron Rivera <a href="http://deadspin.com/5947937/">voluntarily lowered his team&#8217;s odds to win by 25-30%</a> and Matt Ryan led a game winning drive starting from his own 1-yard line with no timeouts and under a minute left. He was pretty <a href="http://thebiglead.fantasysportsven.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/matty-ryan-9-30-12.gif">stoked</a> about it. The Niners blanked the hopeless Jets 34-0 at the New Meadowlands in a huge &#8220;Eff You&#8221; game, while the Patriots blasted the Bills 52-28 with 45 second-half points in their own back-on-track matchup to even their record at 2-2. The Packers narrowly edged the Saints 28-27 and Lambeau while the Cardinals eked out an OT win over Miami to stay a perfect 4-0. On Sunday night the Eagles advanced to 3-1 on a failed last-second field goal by the Giants, and Eli was a little <a href="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/180rvnbop659pgif/original.gif">disappointed</a>. (Check out this <a href="http://deadspin.com/5947629/">Deadspin post</a> for more great week 4 GIFs.)</p>
<p>Things were a little different in fantasy though. While a bunch of high picks who had been underwhelming through three weeks seemed to find their footing, the big stories were the defenses. Now, we did expect defenses to be somewhat more valuable this season as we ratcheted takeaways up to three points from two, but this week was just ridiculous. <em>Five</em> different D/ST units posted 25+ FP outings, with the Niners leading the way with 32. Another five squads posted 16 FP or more. Further, 10 of our 12 teams posted 95 total points or better, although Brian suffered a meteoric production drop going from a league season-best 130 points in week 3 to a miserable 52 in week 4. The league now has four teams at 3-1, four at 2-2, and four at 1-3. I think this really indicates how much attention everyone is paying to the league, and generally how smart everyone was during the draft (no, this isn&#8217;t sarcasm). It&#8217;s great for league parity and week-in, week-out excitement to have just a moderate gap between the top and bottom teams. With nobody winless or undefeated through four weeks and six playoff spots available this is looking to be a very exciting season. Look for the First Quarter Report, which will examine the fantasy landscape through week 4, later this week (UPDATE: rough week at work. Not sure when I&#8217;ll get to it). Let&#8217;s get to it!</p>

<h3>Phil v. Jenny</h3>
<p><em>The Bauce of Sauce v. Still In 1st W a D On My Bench (now &#8220;Sharing 1st W 3 People Sucks&#8221;)</em></p>
<p>Phil had just two standout performances, plus 13 from Anquan Boldin, and won handily anyway. That should indicate how ridiculous the performances of Tom Brady and the Niners D/ST unit were on Sunday. Brady put up a whopping 37, setting the high mark for week four with 340 yards, 3 TD, and a rushing score. The Niners D/ST had 32 FP; even in a week where a bunch of defenses scored 25+ this number is just outrageous. Besides shutting out the Jets, the Niners recorded four takeaways, a defensive touchdown, and four sacks. Aside from that his team&#8217;s numbers were mediocre at best. Most disappointing was Mikel Leshoure who managed just 13 yards on 26 carries; remember, this was the guy who posted 19 FP in his first NFL game in week three. I&#8217;m not ready to write him off yet but he doesn&#8217;t look like the answer to Phil&#8217;s running back problems. Unfortunately he missed out on what will probably end up being Jackie Battle&#8217;s season-high day (19 FP) as the San Diego rushing workload should tilt back in favor of Ryan Mathews now that coach Norv Turner has <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/resources/playernews?playerId=13204">taught him a lesson.</a> To add to this mess Greg Jennings aggravated his groin injury Sunday, and it&#8217;s still unclear when exactly the Patriots are expecting Aaron Hernandez back. Still, getting 69 FP from two roster spots makes it awfully hard to lose and Phil was able to even his record at 2-2. On the other side of the score sheet, Jenny suffered her first loss despite having five guys in double-digits and two with 20+. Eli Manning and Marques Colston each notched 21 FP, although I should note that Colston&#8217;s touchdown came on a missed offensive pass interference call in the end zone. The problem spot for Jenny was running back â€“ Ray Rice pitched in just 8 FP after going 20, 14, 20 in weeks one through three. He took his 18 carries for a meager 49 yards, just one yard more than backup Bernard Pierce gained on just six carries. Flacco legging one into the end zone from short yardage didn&#8217;t help matters. One takeaway here is that, while the Browns are bad, their defense isn&#8217;t terrible; they&#8217;re right around league average in <a href="http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef">defensive DVOA.</a> But Ray Rice will bounce back but Shonn Greene won&#8217;t. He provides absolutely zero upside for a team that is struggling everywhere on offense right now. He can&#8217;t catch passes, and isn&#8217;t a skilled runner, and is widely thought to be one of the worst starting backs in the league. With big changes likely on the way for the Jets&#8217; offense I think we&#8217;ll be seeing more Bilal Powell and less Shonn Greene over the next couple of weeks. If this actually happens Jenny will be completely stuck at running back; behind Rice and Greene she has James Starks (zero carries this year so far) and Isaac Redman (losing his job to Rashard Mendenhall). I guess that&#8217;s what happens when you <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/tools/transactioncounter?leagueId=584667">don&#8217;t pick up free agents</a>&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Phil 116 (2-2); Jenny 101 (3-1)</strong></p>
<h3>Pat v. Brian</h3>
<p><em>Town Taxes v. We Got Nicks Like Jesus</em></p>
<p>Alright, so through three weeks Brian&#8217;s team looked far better than I gave him credit for in the draft grading recap. But I&#8217;m vindicated now. Brian failed to even score <em>half</em> as many points as Pat, amassing just 52 FP from his starting nine. Granted, Brian was facing some injury and bye week problems (Hakeem Nicks and Darrius Heyward-Bey were sidelined with injuries and Ben Roethlisberger was on bye), but this was still a dismal outing. Backup QB Josh Freeman had a listless 14 FP against the terrible Redskins secondary. Aside from Freeman and Eric Decker (13 FP) nobody else reached double digits. Darren McFadden muddled through the Raiders/Broncos blowout with just 34 yards on 13 carries (3 FP), and Ahmad Bradshaw has been demoted to a timeshare with Andre Brown and only gathered 39 yards on his 13 carries (6 FP). While a week off may help get Nicks and Heyward-Bey back soon (Raiders have a week five bye though), Sunday brought more problems than it solved. Santonio Holmes suffered what could be a serious foot injury and while CJ Spiller was active he didn&#8217;t flash the killer speed and elusiveness he showed in the first two weeks. Also, with Fred Jackson back in the mix Spiller&#8217;s fantasy outlook dims considerably. On the other side of this matchup, the Red Rocket era has officially begun, with Dalton turning in a nice 24-point performance as Cincinnati torched Jacksonville. With big contributions from running backs Marshawn Lynch (20) and Alfred Morris (17 FP) this one was in the bag quickly. The biggest performance came from Roddy White (28 FP) who was already working on an extremely solid 100+ yard, 2 TD outing when he caught a 60-yard bomb from Matt Ryan on the opening play of the Falcons&#8217; game winning drive. Aside from a hard hit on Calvin Johnson which briefly sidelined him, there were really no bumps in the road for Pat&#8217;s team.</p>
<p><strong>Pat 105 (2-2); Brian 52 (2-2)</strong></p>
<h3>Dave v. Ali</h3>
<p><em>That&#8217;s No Moon v. Chomo Se Dice: Bolsa De Bolsas</em></p>
<p>I said last week that Dave wouldn&#8217;t be getting 25 from his D/ST again anytime soon, and I was right: he got 29 this time. Going into MNF this matchup was 99-97 in Dave&#8217;s favor with Ali and Dave having only Cowboys D/ST and Bears D/ST left respectively. Given the inconsistent play of both quarterbacks I had no clue what to expect. Through the first three games Cutler committed six turnovers while Romo had five and with the three points awarded per takeaway this was the contest to watch. Romo ended up with a stupefying five interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns including a rumbling 74-yard return by linebacker Lance Briggs. The Cowboys defense was only able to force once turnover, a fumble, from Cutler and Ali ended up on the receiving end of a dominant performance by Peppers, Urlacher, Briggs, &amp; Co. Not that it would have changed the outcome of the matchup, but this highlights the stupidity of ESPN charging D/ST units with points scored by the opposing defense. The Points Allowed column for the Cowboys D/ST shows 34, but they only surrendered 20 of those points. This is a tough one since, besides disappointing outings from MJD and Vernon Davis, his team looked very strong. MJD&#8217;s 7 point day was particularly suprising as the Bengals had been trampled by opposing running backs through the first three weeks. Two risky picks paid off with Jamaal Charles piling up 17 points despite losing two fumbles and Peyton (31 FP) absolutely shredding the Raiders defense. But Dave&#8217;s team was excellent overall even though he was forced to start Daniel Thomas as he had three flex-eligible guys on bye. A number of Dave&#8217;s draft picks are starting to round out into fantasy studs. After a rough first game, Trent Richardson has averaged nearly 17 FP per week since then. Stevan Ridley has been up and down with two 20+ days and two single-digit outings, but when he gets going he&#8217;s hard to stop. Finally, over the last two weeks Kevin Kolb and Larry Fitzgerald have started to click, with Fitz catching 17 balls in those games and averaging 14.5 FP per week. Further, his speculative add of James Jones could pay off in spades; Greg Jennings will sit this week, and possibly the next couple games, to give his sore groin time to fully heal. Jordy Nelson (also on Dave&#8217;s roster) will move to WR1 with James Jones, Donald Driver, and Randall Cobb picking up the slack. Odds are Jones will get the most snaps although that could change quickly if he continues to make mental errors. Either way, look out for Dave.</p>
<p><strong>Dave 127 (3-1); Ali 98 (1-3)</strong></p>
<h3>Nick v. AJ</h3>
<p><em>Charlie&#8217;s $150 Dick Rash v. No Work Today</em></p>
<p>Frankly, I was pretty lucky to escape this one with a win. The decision to start Ben Tate over Willis McGahee was particularly bad (my thinking was that Tate would get a load of garbage time touches in an effort to rest Arian Foster&#8230; Whoops). Further, the Giants D/ST failed to record a takeaway from the Eagles, who through week 3 had been the most turnover prone team in the league. Finally, Julio Jones reeled in just a single catch for 30 yards. The surprise stud was midweek plug-in Scott Chandler who grabbed in two touchdowns against the Patriots and helped propel me to victory. Riding the pine for my team was Brian Hartline who recorded a stunning 31 FP on 253 yards receiving plus a score. Do I absolutely have to start this guy now? I caught another lucky break as just one of AJ&#8217;s six WR/RB/TE reached the end zone (Brandon Lloyd, 11 FP). Percy Harvin&#8217;s receiving TD drought is getting tough to stomach but he&#8217;ll start scoring eventually (more on this in the forthcoming First Quarter Report), although I&#8217;m glad it didn&#8217;t begin this week. Although he got a solid 17 from the Arizona D/ST and 23 from Joe Flacco the touchdown drought of his skill position guys put this one in the bag for me. Danny Amendola put up 11 FP on AJ&#8217;s bench and his remarkable consistency to this point means he should probably be starting until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>Nick 99 (3-1); AJ 88 (1-3)</strong></p>
<h3>Zak v. Max</h3>
<p><em>Chain Gang v. Fuck You Aaron Sorkin</em></p>
<p>Yet another boom/bust day for Zak. He had three guys over 15 and nobody else in double digits, including a 1-point day from Andre Brown and a goose egg from Kyle Rudolph. Drew Brees really carried this one, posting 35 FP on the losing end of a shootout with Green Bay. This is precisely the kind of production you hope for with an elite quarterback like Brees, a performance that can single-handedly win a matchup for you. In fact, the awfulness of the Saints defense may be a boon for Brees&#8217;s fantasy value as he&#8217;s been playing from behind for a good chunk of the year. On the other hand, the Saints had no problem <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=311023018">running up the score</a> last year so this point is debatable. The big surprise was Michael Turner, who upended (for now) the &#8220;he&#8217;s done&#8221; narrative with a big outing against Carolina. I&#8217;m still not convinced he&#8217;ll be the highest scoring running back on the Falcons at the end of the season, and it&#8217;s worth noting that 12 of his 22 points this week came from something you will probably never see Turner do again: take a short pass 60 yards for a touchdown. His previous longest reception was 32 yards and he has never (<em>never!</em>) recorded a receiving touchdown before this past Sunday. He&#8217;ll continue to churn the clock in blowouts and convert in short yardage situations but I&#8217;d be shocked if this wasn&#8217;t his best game of the season. Plus, Carolina sucks against running backs. Zak has some substantial issues at running back which Turner&#8217;s big day glossed over, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like Andre Brown is going to take a lot of carries away from Ahmad Bradshaw. If Turner struggles, and against better defenses I believe he will, the running back position could become a problem spot for Zak. On the other hand, he&#8217;s got four great receivers in Wes Welker, Demaryius Thomas, DeSean Jackson, and Dez Bryant, plus the erratic Lance Moore. Aside from Welker these are all big boom/bust players but when they hit, they hit big and they&#8217;ll definitely pull out a matchup or two for Zak at some point. On the other hand, Zak has by far the fewest points scored among any of the 3-1 teams, and fewer overall points than Ali who&#8217;s 1-3. This is his third win; the first was by two points, the second was decided by a tiebreaker, and this one was by three points. Some regression is certainly due, especially given that this team is averaging just 89.5 a week (league average is 92.5). Max&#8217;s team had five guys in double-digits but the donut from tight end Dennis Pitta and a measly 5 FP from Matt Forte caused him to come up a little short. On the bright side, Chris Johnson finally had his breakout day with 15 FP against the staunch Houston defense. Admittedly, much of this came in garbage time but it still bodes well going forward. AJ Green and Brandon Marshall (17 and 19 FP) both had great days also and both clearly have excellent chemistry with their quarterbacks. Once Matt Forte and Reggie Bush get back on track Max will be tough to stop IF Chris Johnson can be a reliable starter. The potential lineup of Johnson, Forte, Green, Marshall, Olsen, and Bush as the six RB/WR/TE is a monster with solid consistency mixed with major upside. I think this team is much better than a 1-3 record would indicate.</p>
<p><strong>Zak 103 (3-1); Max 100 (1-3)</strong></p>
<h3>Hoop v. ZM</h3>
<p><em>The Whole World is a Couch v. Orange County Gunners</em></p>
<p>After posting just 60 points in week 3 Hoop roared back with a 123 point outing to get back to .500. Aaron Rodgers finally justified the number one overall pick with a 34 FP day, albeit against the miserable Saints defense. The Texans D/ST unit pitched in a colossal 28 FP behind two pick-sixes, a fumble recovery, and four sacks as Houston throttled Tennessee. Frank Gore and Adrian Peterson had 13 and 12 respectively which helped lock in this win. The risky AP draft pick is clearly paying off, but Hoop still has his fair share of roster problems. First, after back-to-back double-digit outings to start the season Doug Martin has posted just 7 and 3 in the last two weeks. LeGarrette Blount had six carries to Martin&#8217;s eight, including a goal-line tote which is worrisome going forward. Plus Brandon LaFell hasn&#8217;t exactly panned out so far although that shouldn&#8217;t be too much of a problem if Davone Bess can keep improving, and Hoop will have Antonio Brown back from bye this week as well. Cam Newton had an excellent fantasy outing for ZM (34 FP), even though fumbled away the Panthers chances on Sunday (he fumbled backwards after converting a third-and-short, and while it was recovered by the Panthers they elected to punt). LeSean McCoy had a modest 13-point day but has really been underwhelming considering ZM selected him first among running backs. He&#8217;s currently tied for 16th at his position with the likes of Andre Brown and Darren Sproles. Not to knock those guys, but McCoy was a consensus top-3 back, and he&#8217;s only averaging a hair over 10 points a game through four weeks. A bit more points wouldn&#8217;t have helped this week but it sure would have in the tie against Zak. On the other hand Vincent Jackson has been a pleasant surprise. He put up 16 FP this week and is currently 6th in yards per catch (19.0), 12th in fantasy points among receivers, and has 304 yards and two scores through four weeks. Not bad for the 27th receiver off the board in the draft. But with Steve Smith barely contributing (7.8 FPPG; 35th among WR) ZM has to hope V-Jax continues to shine or things will go downhill quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Hoop 123 (2-2); ZM 95 (1-3)</strong></p>
