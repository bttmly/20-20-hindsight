<h6>Danny Amendola is outperforming his fantasy draft spot by the largest margin of any receiver so far this year. UPDATE: Amendola suffered a serious collarbone injury Thursday night against the Cardinals.</h6>

<p>I want to start by talking about the draft. When choosing a player, you&#8217;re not necessarily drafting whatever guy on the board you think will have the most points at the end of the season. Positional scarcity is very important, which is why in most leagues (with 4 points for passing touchdowns) the top running backs come off first, even though they&#8217;ll still be outscored by the top quarterbacks. We award 6 points for passing touchdowns which changes the relative scarcity of truly elite quarterbacks (those who throw a ton of TDs) since the value balance between yards and touchdowns is shifted substantially. Also your draft pick position impacts who you take; for instance, you might not really need a third running back in the fourth round but you realize that if you don&#8217;t take one there will be nobody decent left there, so you pass on a receiver you might rather have. Anyway, that said, whenever you draft a guy <em>of a given position</em> the throught process is that he will be the highest scoring guy <em>at that position</em> currently remaining on the board. Actually, not always, since you might take a flyer on a guy who has a 1-in-25 shot of being a top-10 receiver because while you expect him to do worse than other guys on the board, if he pays off it&#8217;ll help you a ton, and if he doesn&#8217;t then you just dump him eventually. Nonetheless you&#8217;re looking for the best available guy at that position.</p>

<p>What I wanted to do was compare position draft rank (PDR) to current position rank (CPR). For example, Calvin Johnson was drafted first among WRs so his PDR is 1. He&#8217;s currently 7th among fantasy WRs in scoring so his CPR is 7. Next, I subtracted these values (PDR - CPR) to see how many spots away from their draft position various receivers currently are. The biggest difference was Danny Amendola who was 59th among receivers in the draft and is currently 11th in fantasy points, good for a 48 spot move. Other big movers were James Jones (38 spots), Mike Williams and Lance Moore (22 spots each). A handful of guys were extremely close (within one spot) of their draft position, including Victor Cruz, Brandon Marshall, Mike Wallace, Demaryius Thomas, and Anquan Boldin. I&#8217;m sure what we&#8217;re most interested are the real stinkers though. Bringing up the absolute rear is Greg Jennings who&#8217;s currently 80th among WRs in scoring but was drafted 6th at his position, a -74 spot difference. Here are the other guys who are -30 or worse: Jeremy Maclin, Titus Young, Michael Floyd, Hakeem Nicks, Laurent Robinson (in the 30s); Darrius Heyward-Bey (-40), Justin Blackmon (-51), and Robert Meachem (-65).</p>
<p>Looking at spot changes is illustrative, but looking at the actual points above or below expected is more informative. Only 22 receivers are performing at or above their expected level based on their draft position. Here they are below in order of least excess value to most: <strong>(UPDATE: Ugh. Tumblr doesn&#8217;t display HTML tables&#8230;)</strong></p>
<p>Brandon Marshall: 0<br/>Demaryius Thomas: 0<br/>Anquan Boldin: 0<br/>Mike Wallace: 0<br/>Victor Cruz: 0.2<br/>Eric Decker: 0.2<br/>Percy Harvin: 0.5<br/>Nate Burleson: 0.5<br/>DeSean Jackson: 0.8<br/>Vincent Jackson: 1.7<br/>Nate Washington: 1.7<br/>Davone Bess: 2.0<br/>Lance Moore: 2.2<br/>Mike Williams: 2.5<br/>Miles Austin: 3.2<br/>A.J. Green: 3.5<br/>Dwayne Bowe: 3.5<br/>Torrey Smith: 3.7<br/>James Jones: 4.0<br/>Reggie Wayne: 4.0<br/>Roddy White: 5.0<br/>Danny Amendola: 5.8</p>
<p>Remember, a mark of 0 means they are currently exactly at the rank at their position as they were in the draft.</p>
<p>To take this a step further, I compared each player&#8217;s average fantasy points per week to the average fantasy points of the guy who&#8217;s current <em>real</em> position is the other player&#8217;s <em>draft</em> position. That&#8217;s a little confusing, so here&#8217;s an example. A.J. Green is currently the top scoring fantasy receiver, averaging 15 a week, but was taken 8th at his position. So to compare how much value he&#8217;s giving I compared his average points to the average points of the current 8th WR in scoring (Miles Austin, 11.5 FP/wk) gives you a measure of 3.5 points/week (so far) in excess of his draft spot. Obviously, this isn&#8217;t a great system. One better way to gauge it would be to measure it against average fantasy output <em>last</em> season, since that&#8217;s the baseline we&#8217;re working from. Even better might be the average of the past three, or so, seasons. But this measure still shows where a receiver should have been taken relative to where they were actually taken, up to this point int he season. This also avoids the difficult task of comparing value across positions, especially when you figure in the flex spot which makes everything ten times more messy.</p>
<p>For each owner I also took the average of all their receivers&#8217; relative productivity numbers. So for example, AJ drafted five receivers: Brandon Lloyd, Percy Harvin, Malcolm Floyd, Alshon Jeffery, and Danny Amendola. Using the method described above I found their value relative to their draft spot at their position to be, in order: -3.2, 0.5, -0.7, -1, 5.8. Remember, these numbers are how many points per week they are over/underperforming compared to the WR who is currently the <em>n</em>th best receiver, where <em>n</em> is where they were drafted among all receivers. So the average of AJ&#8217;s guys is a respectable .28, meaning overall he&#8217;s getting an extra .28 points per week from his receivers due to his (luck / skill; pick one) at grabbing receivers in the draft. Brian has by far the worst in this area with -3.375 largely due to Hakeem Nicks&#8217;s injury. Not to toot my own horn here but I rated as the best with 0.975 thanks to Torrey Smith and Reggie Wayne who have dramatically outperformed their draft spots. Going by average points per game (only way to do it since the Colts and Steelers have already had a bye), Smith and Wayne are fourth and ninth respectively among receivers. Max also came out pretty well in this (0.4 average) but a ton of that is thanks to A.J. Green currently sitting atop the fantasy receiver list, and because he drafted just three receivers so each one has a big impact on his total. Besides Max, AJ and myself, Pat was the only other owner to have a positive number at just 0.1. Pat also has the largest magnitude numbers â€“ Calvin Johnson, Michael Crabtree and Jon Baldwin are all underperforming by at least -2.5 points a game, while Roddy White and Dwayne Bowe are ahead of the curve by 5 and 3.5 per week respectively.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how much value this whole excercise has but it&#8217;s an interesting way to look at a single position thorugh four weeks. I&#8217;ll probably try to come up with something a little different if/when I look at running backs. I&#8217;m also currently trying to figure out the best way to post spreadsheets so if you have any ideas let me know.</p>
