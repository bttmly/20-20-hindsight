<div class="perma-only">
<span>Pretty great week for our league – five out of six games ended with single-digit margins with three of those coming down to Monday night. Team scores were way down across the league this week as six teams were on bye and many were forced to insert bench guys or free agents. Here are your week 7 recaps&#8230;</span> <!-- more -->


<h3>Nick v. Brian</h3>
<h4>Charlie&#8217;s $150 Dick Rash v. We Got Nicks Like Jesus</h4>
<p>It seems every year there&#8217;s a few defenses that make every fantasy owner salivate. Last year the Colts and Bucs were particularly atrocious. The 2011 Packers and Patriots were both electric on offense but got dragged into shoot-outs by their worthless secondaries. Those defenses were so bad, so <em>historically</em> bad they could elevate a mediocre fantasy fill-in into a a one-week stud. This season there are a few defenses that are so horrifically inept you have to basically start whoever on your roster who is facing them, and the Saints are leading this miserable group by a wide margin. While not dead last in scoring defense (29th), they are allowing an unbelievable 465.5 yards of offense per game. You just have to start anybody and everybody against this team. But when I noticed Brian had elected to go with Big Ben versus the Bengals rather than Josh Freeman against the Saints I just sat back and said to myself, &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-sp0b33fbs#t=01m12s">please proceed, Governor.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a minor miracle I managed to escape with a win despite my four draft picks from rounds two through five being on bye at the same time (Julio Jones, Ryan Mathews, Willis McGahee, and Matty Ice). When news emerged on Saturday that Rashard Mendenhall would sit out the Sunday night matchup with Cincinnati I had to scrabble to adjust my roster, eventually landing on Phillip Tanner as a starting running back. Yikes. Anyway, as I mentioned above there are a few cupcake defenses that demand attention when setting your lineup or planning for bye weeks. Aside from New Orleans, the two worst defenses in the league are arguably Buffalo and Tennessee who were playing each other this week. I grabbed Fitzpatrick in anticipation of this matchup given Matt Ryan&#8217;s bye and it completely paid off – he went for 23 FP (225 yds., 3 TD) despite committing two turnovers. Arian Foster was able to conceal the fact that the Houston rushing attack has taken a dip this year by recording two touchdowns for the second straight game. Not sure what I mean here? Well Houston is averaging 4.0 yards per carry, sitting right in the middle of the league at 16th. But the least efficient rushing team in the league is averaging 3.5 YPC, meaning all of the below-average rushing attacks are in the narrow 3.5 – 4.0 YPC band. In comparison, the most efficient running team (our beloved Niners) is amassing 5.9 yards per carry, nearly 50% better than the Texans. Here&#8217;s another example: the Texans are tied for the league lead in rushing attempts with 248.(incredibly, their co-leader is New England). Despite rushing the most, they&#8217;re back at fifth in yards, over 250 yards behind the league-leading Redskins. In <a href="http://footballoutsiders.com/info/methods#DVOA">DVOA</a> the Houston rushing attack <a href="http://footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamoff2012">is just 10th</a> in the league. Obviously I&#8217;m not bemoaning the situation here; Arian Foster is way ahead of all other fantasy running backs and has scored 10 total touchdowns through seven games. But we&#8217;re not seeing the monster yardage games he&#8217;s produced frequently over the past two seasons indicating teams may be figuring out the Texans vaunted zone blocking scheme a little bit. But Fitzpatrick, Foster, and a decent showing from the Cowboys D/ST allowed me to gain enough breathing room to stave off Brian&#8217;s two Sunday night guys (Roethlisberger and Jermaine Gresham).</p>
<p>Oakland kicker Sebastian Janikowski actually led Brian&#8217;s team in points with 14; Roethlisberger kicked in 13 and Ahmad Bradshaw contributed 12. CJ Spiller (10) was his only other guy in double-digits. The decision to bench Freeman was absolutely the deciding factor here; Freeman outscored Roethlisberger by 21 points and my margin of victory was just nine. Take a lesson from this one, folks: check out the shittiest defenses in the league and adjust accordingly. The Saints defense can make anybody a star. If your <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/11237">usual starting QB</a> is in the same division as the Saints and gets to play them twice? Even better.</p>
<h5>Nick 74 (5-2); Brian 65 (3-4)</h5>
<h3>Zak v. Hooper</h3>
<h4>Chain Gang v. The Whole World is a Couch</h4>
<p>With the (baseball) Giants capping off their pennant run with a 9-0 shellacking of the (baseball) Cardinals last night, I&#8217;m sure fantasy football is in a distant second place in the sports lobe of Zak&#8217;s brain (congrats, by the way). I draw this conclusion partially from the fact that he usually makes at least three add/drops at midnight on Tuesdays (but made zero this week), and partially from the fact I haven&#8217;t received any texts about this tough loss. Zak found out the hard way that it&#8217;s very difficult to knock off a team with two outstanding running backs and the best quarterback in the NFL. Despite putting up his best outing of the season (117 FP) he still fell short of Hoop this week. Zak shored up his running back corps this week by prying the underwhelming Chris Johnson away from Max in exchange for Christian Ponder and Dez Bryant. This trade paid off instantly as Johnson shredded the Bills for 195 yards and a pair of touchdowns on just 18 carries for 31 FP. However the issues with Chris Johnson are the same today as they were yesterday – he&#8217;s an athletic shifty guy who works best with a little space, something which his offensive line has been unable to provide. The Bills are among the worst defenses in the league, and while the level of his production was obviously surprising, the fact that he had a good day really wasn&#8217;t. The Titans have nine games to go, four of which are against the Colts and Jags – however the second Colts game is the first week of fantasy playoffs, and the second Jacksonville game is week 17 (after the conclusion of the fantasy season). So the Titans have five games left before the start of the fantasy playoffs, and three of those games are against the Bears, Dolphins, and Texans. Granted, CJ ran well against the Texans in their first meeting but I don&#8217;t think lightning will strike twice against that defense. The Bears and Dolphins have so far been able to largely shut down opposing running backs. I&#8217;m going to reserve judgement on this trade until we see how the next three weeks shake out. We can say one thing though: this will almost certainly end up as CJ&#8217;s best outing of the year and Zak had the misfortune to play the one team in the league that outscored him this week. In addition to Johnson&#8217;s fireworks display, Drew Brees piled up 36 FP against the Bucs. In the absence of Jimmy Graham, Lance Moore has emerged as a serious fantasy weapon; he reeled in nine balls for 121 yards, but didn&#8217;t reach the end zone. The huge bye week hurt Zak&#8217;s depth elsewhere though, particularly at receiver with Demaryius Thomas and DeSean Jackson both out. With Michael Turner also out, Zak had to go with Daryl Richardson. Richardson managed 7 FP, so he wasn&#8217;t really a bust, but obviously starting a running back in line to get 7-12 offensive touches is less than desirable.</p>
<p>While Aaron Rodgers is the big name on his team, Hooper rises and falls with his running backs and they came through in a big way this week. Adrian Peterson (21 FP), Frank Gore (18 FP), and Doug Martin (17 FP) all posted season-high numbers in their respective contests. While Peterson&#8217;s performance wasn&#8217;t that surprising against a league-average Arizona run defense, and Martin predictably shredded the bottom-dwelling Saints run stopping unit, Gore&#8217;s Thursday night outing was truly impressive. Above, I said &#8220;two outstanding running backs&#8221; which isn&#8217;t a mistake – Peterson and Gore are great, Martin had a good game against a shitty defense. Playing through pain and against one of the toughest run defenses in the league, Gore carried 16 times for 131 yards and caught five balls for 51. Let&#8217;s look a little closer at these numbers to understand how good Gore was. First, just look at the YPC: nearly 8.2. That&#8217;s a CJ Spiller / Jamaal Charles level number from a guy known for hard-nosed, bruising running. If you watched the game you&#8217;ll probably remember Gore picking up chuck yardage up the middle for most of the fourth quarter as the Niners sought to grind down the clock. Frankly this looked a lot like what Ahmad Bradshaw did to the Niners themselves the previous week. The difference here was that the game was not out of reach for the Seahawks. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;d all like to think of football players as indomitable warriors who never take a play off and play through the last whistle, blah blah blah. But the reality is when you&#8217;re getting smoked 26-3 you might just pack it in, avoid the chance of a garbage time injury, and come back to play another day. This is what happened to the Niners against the Giants and I&#8217;m fine with that. But for a defense that has been praised as mentally and physically tough all year, the Seahawks quit in this game (or were simply too tired and beat-up to continue) even though they were down just one score. I really believe the human bowling ball Frank Gore, along with the Niners&#8217; O-line, had a lot to do with this. Before the Seahawks visited Candlestick they were surrendering just 3.25 YPC and had held every team they faced to 87 rushing yards or fewer. But whatever the Niners did worked like magic, and if anyone was wondering which team is more physical I think that question has been put to bed. I will admit right now that I didn&#8217;t anticipate Frank Gore being so ridiculously effective this season after he trailed off towards the end of last year, but as a Niners fan it&#8217;s fucking great. The rest of Hoop&#8217;s guys fared so-so or worse; Antonio Brown had 10 FP on 109 yards from scrimmage, while Martellus Bennett had a pedestrian 7 FP. Still, that was better than Kenny Britt&#8217;s 3 FP against the miserable Buffalo defense in a game where a guy with his talent could go for 130 yards and a pair of touchdowns. I&#8217;m wondering about the decision to start the Giants D/ST against Washington instead of the Texans D/ST versus Baltimore. In my mind Houston defense is better than the Giants defense, and the Washington offense is better than the Baltimore offense so, what&#8217;s the reasoning here? Luckily it didn&#8217;t come back to bite Hoop in the ass in the final score.</p>
<h5>Hoop 124 (5-2); Zak 117 (5-2)</h5>
<h3>Dave v. Jenny</h3>
<h4>That&#8217;s No Moon v. Sharing 1st W 3 People Sucks</h4>
<p>Well, the Bears defense didn&#8217;t lead Dave&#8217;s team in scoring but they did carry him to a victory. With RG3 putting up 24, Jordy Nelson contributing 18 and even Heath Miller reaching double-digits thanks to a touchdown and two point conversion, Dave was able to overcome disappointing performances by some key guys. Stevan Ridley managed just six FP against the Jets while Trent Richardson suffered an early rib injury and spent most of the game on the sideline after grabbing just a single fantasy point. Larry Fitzgerald (2 FP) couldn&#8217;t get anything going either. Still, he had the good fortune to go up against Jenny when the Ravens&#8217; game plan mysteriously didn&#8217;t involve Ray Rice, who managed just five FP. Aside from Rice, her skill position starters all reached double digits. The problem, however, is that nobody had a truly great outing. Big performances at the right time from three main guys (Eli, Ray Rice, and Marques Colston) along with Shonn Greene&#8217;s bolt from the blue 34-point day last week, have helped her secure victories so far (obviously this is often the case for teams with winning records). Going in to MNF Jenny was up 93-80 with Lions kicker Jason Hanson left for her and the Bears D/ST going for Dave. I talked about it before but, damn, the Bears defense has been on fire so far this season. Going into this game they had allowed six offensive touchdowns while scoring five defensive touchdowns! They handled business for Dave yet again – and in a variety of ways. They kept Jenny&#8217;s kicker out of field goal range for the most part. When they didn&#8217;t they generated turnovers in the red zone to prevent scores. Ultimately they had four takeaways – two red zone forced fumbles (including one on the goal line), a muffed punt recovery, and a late pick near the goal line. Although they let the shutout slip away right at the end of the game when the Lions scored with 0:30-ish left, the Chicago defense was a huge fantasy factor yet again.</p>
<h5>Dave 100 (4-3); Jenny 94 (5-2)</h5>
<h3>Pat v. Max</h3>
<h4>Town Taxes v. Fuck You Aaron Sorkin</h4>
<p>Pat has two people to thank for this one: Ndamukong Suh for doing <a href="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/183081t6ee5vlgif/original.gif">this</a> to Jay Cutler, and Chicago offensive coordinator Mike Tice for continuing to call pass plays after that hit. If you didn&#8217;t watch the game that might require a little explanation. The monster takedown by Suh is self-explanatory – just watch him drive Cutler into the ground with his body. Cutler tucks the (hard, highly inflated) ball to secure it and ends up getting body slammed right on to it by 300s+ lbs. of malice. Jason Campbell took over momentarily before Cutler tried one more play before halftime then went straight to the locker room before returning for the third quarter. It was obvious the rib injury had sapped a considerable amount of Cutler&#8217;s arm strength – his release was off and he was arming balls into the dirt at his receivers&#8217; feet. He went 7-for-15 in the second half, which isn&#8217;t horrible, but all those passes were of the short and inconsequential variety. I find it hard to believe a healthy Cutler would have allowed the Lions to hang around within two possessions. More likely, he would have tried a shot (or two, or three) down the field to Brandon Marshall to put the game away. Had one of those hypothetical passes succeeded Max would have won the fantasy matchup handily. Alternately, the coaching staff could have moved to a more run-heavy attack, as both Matt Forte and Michael Bush were playing well, which could have also given Max a chance to win. They chose to do neither and despite having the Bears two main offensive threats (Marshall and Matt Forte) Max couldn&#8217;t overcome the deficit. Pat had Megatron going in this game also, but he was largely a non-factor as the Bears elected to devote their attention to him and force the Lions to look elsewhere for production. Calvin Johnson reeled in just three of his 11 targets. Among those eight he missed included a drop across the middle with plenty of space to run and a catch in the endzone batted out of his hands by cornerback Charles Tillman. Tillman handled Johnson as well as anybody possibly could and he still needed consistent safety help which should tell you just how incredibly good Megatron is.</p>
<p>Max&#8217;s team struggled, with nobody besides Marshall and fill-in QB Matt Hasselbeck able to reach double-digits. Sure, there were a lot of byes this week but Max only had one starter (Reggie Bush) on bye anyway. Worse, the two pieces Max got in return for Chris Johnson from Zak (Dez Bryant and Christian Ponder) put up just three FP combined. Though Ponder was sitting, his numbers were abysmal - 8-17 for 58 yards, a touchdown and two picks. Pat was able to get low double-digits from both Alfred Morris and Marshawn Lynch, but the standout performer was the Vikings D/ST which had 22 FP against the Cardinals (two takeaways, one defensive touchdown, and an astounding seven sacks). Looking at <a href="http://sports-ak.espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=321021016">the numbers</a> it&#8217;s astounding the Vikings won. They were outgained 356 yards to 209; Arizona had 21 first downs while they had just 12; they ran 47 offensive plays to Arizona&#8217;s 69; and they possessed the ball for ten fewer minutes than the Cardinals. Nuts.</p>
<h5>Pat 72 (2-4); Max 67 (2-4)</h5>
<h3>Ali v. ZM</h3>
<h4>Chomo Se Dice: Salsa Con&#8230; v. Orange County Gunners</h4>
<p>At first I was pretty surprised to see Ali had managed a win with his two best players, Peyton Manning and Jamaal Charles, on bye. But then I remembered ZM has four Carolina Panthers on his roster and it all made sense. It didn&#8217;t help that ZM had LeSean McCoy on bye and was forced to start two RBs near the waiver level – DeAngelo Williams and Danny Woodhead. Vincent Jackson&#8217;s monster day was the only thing that kept this game close. In fact, had the lumbering Jackson not been tackled at the one yard line after a <em>95-yard</em> catch and run (the longest non-scoring reception in 40 years) this matchup would have been a nailbiter. V-Jax is the only thing ZM really has going for him – the guy has five touchdowns already this year and has posted 16 FP or better in every week but two. But it&#8217;s hard to win matchups when you&#8217;re roster is clogged with underperforming Panthers and you choose to roll the dice with the Bills D/ST unit. They&#8217;re 22nd in fantasy points at that position and second-to-last in yards allowed per game. For God&#8217;s sake, drop them ASAP. This entire matchup came down to two huge pass plays. I mentioned Jackson&#8217;s long non-score earlier where he left six FP on the table. The other big play was on Ali&#8217;s squad where Victor Cruz managed to get over the top on the Redskins and go 70 yards for a game-winning touchdown. Obviously it&#8217;s great to win but Ali had some big problems here. First, Vernon Davis has inexplicably vanished from the Niners offense. Second, MJD went down with a sprained foot early in the Jacksonville-Oakland game and will miss a few weeks or more. He&#8217;s got LaRod Stephens-Howling waiting in the wings but my gut feeling is that 20-point outing last week was an anomaly that we won&#8217;t see repeated anytime soon. Unless Jamaal Charles and Peyton Manning can shoulder the load this will get ugly quick.</p>
<h5>Ali 74 (3-4); ZM 66 (2-5)</h5>
<h3>Phil v. AJ</h3>
<h4>The Bauce of Sauce v. No Work Today</h4>
<p>With the other five match-ups going down to the wire and finishing with single-digit margins, only Phil was able to deliver a decisive knockout punch last weekend. Brady was efficient as usual (22 FP) but hasn&#8217;t shown the kind of upside many, including myself, expected of him. The only team he&#8217;s really been able to dissect this year was Buffalo, and shit, even Mark Sanchez demolished those guys. Aside from the game against the Bills, and a 15 point outing in a loss to the Cardinals, he&#8217;s been within the narrow 19-22 FP range every week. As expected, Steven Jackson is seeing a workload reduction as St. Louis tries to give more snaps and experience to Daryl Richardson – in seven games this year, Jackson has 12 or fewer carries in four outings. He&#8217;s also recorded two or fewer receptions in five games. He did manage to find the end zone this week though and posted his first double-digit game of the season (11 FP). In the other running back spot Alex Green has been a huge disappointment. Over the past two weeks he&#8217;s carried the ball 42 times… for exactly 100 yards – a pathetic 2.4 YPC. Yes, those have been against two competent run defenses but, still, that&#8217;s real bad. On the other hand, waiver acquisition Randall Cobb has been electric (21 FP last week). He&#8217;s caught seven or more balls in four out of seven contests this year and has three touchdowns over the last three weeks including a pair in week seven. He also tends to tack on a point or two rushing – in three different games he&#8217;s seen exactly one carry but he&#8217;s taken those for 28, 20, and 19 yards. He&#8217;s not quite Percy Harvin but with Aaron Rodgers under center, he doesn&#8217;t have to be. The Packers have been making the most of his versatile skill set and it shows both in the Packers&#8217; box scores and in fantasy.</p>
<p>Nothing seems to be clicking on AJ&#8217;s team. DeMarco Murray got hurt two weeks ago then his backup, Felix Jones, got banged up in his first start. The up-tempo offense Baltimore promised never materialized and Joe Flacco has been a bust. The guy has thrown for one or zero TDs in five of seven games. Brandon Lloyd was expected to make a splash with Brady slinging him the long ball but Tom Terrific is suddenly a little squirrely in the pocket. Despite getting nearly all the carries in Cincinnati, the Law Firm has also been a big disappointment. He&#8217;s never been an explosive runner but he could put up yards with enough work and was a beast near the goal line. But for some reason the Bengals haven&#8217;t been giving him the work down there, preferring to divvy it up between a bunch of guys. Green-Ellis has carried from inside the opponent&#8217;s 5-yard line four times this year with one touchdown to show for it. Three other Bengals also have short-yardage touchdowns – Andy Dalton and backup RB Cedric Peerman each ran one in while another backup RB, Chris Pressley, caught a 1-yd touchdown pass. That is a fantasy disaster for Green-Ellis, who should have four or five TDs on the year rather than just two. Finally, Jermichael Finley has squandered what could have been a shot at redemption. He was a disappointment last year with sloppy play and numerous drops and that trend has continued this year. Finley has four drops on the season, the same number as Randall Cobb and one fewer than Jordy Nelson, although Finley has fewer targets and receptions than those guys. The problem is that even when he&#8217;s not dropping the ball he&#8217;s just not that productive. He has just 241 yards on the year with a single TD with an average of 9.3 yards per catch. Compare to Cobb (435 yds., 11.8 avg., 3 TD) and Nelson (532 yds., 13.3 avg., 5 TD) and you see why Rodgers will continue to look elsewhere in the passing game. Although Fred Jackson had 17 FP this week he&#8217;s averaging just 7 FP in games he starts – if you add in the two games he missed to injury his average goes down to five. The only real bright spot has been Percy Harvin, currently sitting at fourth among WRs in fantasy points, who has been a yardage monster and finally started to find the endzone over the last three weeks. I don&#8217;t see a lot of improvement coming in the near future, especially since AJ will need to hit the free agent market for a quarterback with Flacco and Schaub on bye.</p>
