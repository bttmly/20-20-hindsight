    <p class="body-copy">The playoff spots are nearly locked up, however one berth is still undecided. Jenny heads into tonight&#8217;s Giants-Redskins matchup down 27 points to Zak, with Eli Manning still to play. Eli&#8217;s three-week swoon hurt Jenny&#8217;s team badly, but she could still make the playoffs if he steps up tonight.
He posted 28 FP a week ago against the Packers and the Washington secondary has been a liability all season. They&#8217;re 30th in quarterback points against, allowing 20.9 FP per game to opposing signal callers – 4.1 FP more than the league average. However, given the margin Jenny has to make up, it&#8217;ll be an uphill battle. This one could be very close, and should it end in a tie Jenny would take the bench points tiebreaker. The bad news: while the &#8216;Skins have consistently given up solid numbers to signal callers, QBs have scored 27 or more just three times all year. The good news: those QBs were Sam Bradford, Andy Dalton, and Tony Romo. On a good day Eli is miles better than any of those guys – don&#8217;t count Jenny out of it quite yet. Should Jenny win she would get a playoff spot over ZM by virtue of the total points tiebreaker.</p>

<p class="body-copy">Dave and Phil&#8217;s matchup will be decided tonight as well – Dave is down 18 FP with RG3 and Santana Moss left. ESPN&#8217;s projections (and we all know how accurate those are) predict his Washington tandem to rack up 35 FP combined. Even if they don&#8217;t hit that number it would seem unlikely they can&#8217;t cover the 18-point gap. If Dave wins his final score will determine his seed. My point total on the season, including this week, comes to 1270. Dave will need 100 or more points to pass me for the third seed (I have no idea what happens if we tie in total points).</p>

<p class="body-copy">So we have four possible outcomes this evening:</p>
	<ul><li>Zak wins, Dave wins</li>
        <li>Zak wins, Phil wins</li>
		<li>Jenny wins, Dave wins</li>
        <li>Jenny wins, Phil wins</li>
        </ul><p class="body-copy">If Zak wins, ZM makes it in as the sixth seed. If Jenny wins, she gets in. She&#8217;d be the fifth seed if Phil lost, sixth seed if he won. If Dave wins he secures at least the fourth seed, and moves to the third if he scores 100 or more. Frankly, I&#8217;m pretty happy that I won&#8217;t have to face Dave in the first round no matter what since his team is easily the most dangerous of those playing in the first round.</p>
