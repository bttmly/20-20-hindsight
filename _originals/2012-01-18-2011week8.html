<p><em><span id="internal-source-marker_0.7718683268749512">Originally posted 11/1/11</span></em><br/><span><img height=" " src="http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2011/1030/nfl_a_sjacks_576.jpg" width="500"/></span><br/><span></span><br/><span>The  past two weeks have scratched some luster off of the erstwhile top tier  teams. Max is still sitting pretty at 8-0 and will clinch a playoff  spot soon, but Phil and Pat are both in a two game skid, falling to 5-3,  while Dave has dropped three straight and sits on the same record.  Meanwhile, three teams sit directly behind them at 4-4, including Ali  who notched his third straight win this week to get back to .500 after a  1-4 start. This shakeout will continue next week with Pat and Phil&#8217;s  5-3 showdown. Also Andre and myself (both 3-4-1) will each play a 4-4  team, adding another factor to the uncertainty. As it stands now with 6  weeks to go in the regular fantasy season, 6 teams are within 2 games of  a top 4 spot. Let&#8217;s get into it.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>DEM 99 (3-4-1); TUSK 81 (5-3)</span></strong><br/><span>This  upset was almost as big as the Rams over the Saints. Heading in to  Sunday I was projected to lose this one by nearly 50 points. Speaking of  the Rams&#8230; good work, fellas!. They held Drew Brees to a measly 12  fantasy points, while Steven Jackson ran roughshod over the New Orleans  defense and with a 30-point day. Despite Ray Rice having another monster  day (3TDs, 27 fantasy points), lack of core (RBs and WRs) production  left Phil down big going into Monday night. Still, he had star receivers  Dwayne Bowe and Vincent Jackson – if the MNF game became a shootout, he  would have a very real chance to catch up. Fortunately both the Chiefs and  Chargers foundered for most of the game and Bowe and V-Jax only totaled  ten points together. Although it didn&#8217;t end up having any impact, one  puzzling move was Phil&#8217;s decision to start CJ Spiller when potential  upside guys Danny Woodhead and Roy Helu were benched. Looking forward,  the solid production from the 49ers defense will be an asset, and the  set of starting WRs Phil is fielding should eventually get back on track  and start producing big. As for me, picking up the Bengals D/ST as a  bye week fill-in turned out to be a great move. They mauled the Seahawks  with two TDs, two takeaways and four sacks. Another standout was  Antonio Brown, who has benefitted from the extra attention defenses are  giving Mike Wallace as well as from the midseason surge by Ben  Roethlisburger. Overall, this was probably more luck than an indication  of an improving roster – after all, nearly a quarter of my points came  from the Bengals D.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>HUH? 105 (4-4); JUIC 76 (4-4)</span></strong><span><br/>Ali&#8217;s  team is an actual example of an improving roster. Ben Roethlisburger has  shaken off his early season funk and has the Steelers on a roll after  knocking off the Patriots. Brandon Lloyd is finally getting some  production, while second tier receivers Malcolm Floyd and Deion Branch  are exploiting defenses focused elsewhere. Plus Heath Miller looks like  he&#8217;s ramping up his performance, and might be a better option than  Antonio Gates given the impotence of the SD offense. The only dark cloud  in this sky is the hamstring injury Hakeem Nicks sustained this past  week. Apparently it isn&#8217;t serious, but this is an aggravation of an  earlier strain so we&#8217;ll see how it goes. Not that it is a problem now,  with Sproles and Fred Jackson performing at a high level, but Ali has  zero depth at running back – literally; he&#8217;s carrying seven WRs and just  two RBs. As for ZM, he&#8217;ll bounce back since week 8 byes were especially  tought on his starters. He was missing Greg Jennings and Mark Sanchez.  Beanie Wells was on the bench and played well; the weird thing is last  season he had nagging injuries and did terribly and this season he has  nagging injuries and is doing well. He&#8217;s got to be a must start at this  point, even with the sore knee. ZM also should look to add some depth to  this roster; he&#8217;s carrying four QBs and could easily dump two.</span><span></span><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>TWS 102 (8-0); WILL 70 (5-3)</span></strong><br/><span>This  is what happens when Rodgers is on bye – you&#8217;re forced to start Matt  Cassel, who put up a dismal 11 fantasy points (although he did better  than his opponent, Philip Rivers, who had just 10). Also, failing to  check your lineup on Sunday morning doesn&#8217;t help – Daniel Thomas sat out  Sunday against the Giants. Frank Gore&#8217;s performance was stellar but  beyond that it was disappointment through the core of Dave&#8217;s lineup.  Even DeSean Jackson couldn&#8217;t grab a piece of the Eagles 34-7 beatdown of  the Cowboys. We&#8217;ll see how Dave does next week, but he&#8217;s in a three  game slide and Aaron Rodgers <em>did</em> play in the first  two. Anyway, Max won yet again. Un-fucking-believable that this jerk  named his team &#8220;The Winning Streak&#8221; at the start of the season and is  still unbeaten – I thought the Gods punished hubris. Anyway, Eli had yet  another big day with 25 and there were four other double digit  performers. The only real disappointment here was Marques Colston, who  finished with just 5 after getting 17 and 21 in the past two games.  Victor Cruz was on the bench with 15. I think at this point, especially  with the double dip bonus from Eli, Victor Cruz is a must start. Even  though he&#8217;s third on the depth chart behind Nicks and Manningham, both  of those guys have been injured at some point. While Cruz is  unpredictable, he has huge upside and is 11th in points among WRs. This  was the most vulnerable week for Max with both Matt Forte and Darren  McFadden out on bye; with his win here he looks poised to continue the  steak.</span><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>MARC 88 (2-6); ZAK 65 (1-7)</span></strong><br/><span>Jordan&#8217;s  team is becoming what it should have been earlier this season. The  obvious gaping hole is Philip Rivers who has been underperforming all  year and is averaging a meager 15.5 a game - worse than Josh Freeman!  However Adrian Peterson has been earning his keep as the #1 overall  pick, and Steve Smith&#8217;s chemistry with Cam Newton is just unbelievable.  Manningham has been doing well, as has Crabtree. Even Reggie Bush had  double digits this week! Plus the Law Firm should get back on track in  the weeks ahead. Zak&#8217;s team, on the other hand, is&#8230; bad. Especially  when Brady gets less than 30. MJD has been so-so this year, and it goes  downhill from there. Cam Newton has become the lead back in Carolina,  and Jonathan Stewart&#8217;s  numbers are suffering accordingly. Reggie Wayne  plays for Indy – enough said. Jeremy Maclin has been decent, but so much  of the offense is running through LeSean McCoy that neither he nor  DeSean Jackson has been able to put up the numbers they are capable of.  Plus Zak had 5 bye week guys.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>MS 112 (4-4); LINC 55 (3-5)</span></strong><br/><span>Here&#8217;s  what happens when you are in a bunch of leagues: one (or more) of your  teams starts to suck, then you divert all your energy away from that  league since you have already thrown in the towel. How else would you  explain starting Delone Carter, LaRod Stephens-Howling and Michael  Jenkins all in the same week? Or keeping Kyle Orton on the bench when he  has lost his job for good (seriously, he&#8217;s not coming back – they&#8217;ll  test drive Brady Quinn at some point then target a QB with a top 5 pick  in 2012)? Or Lee Evans? His mysterious ankle injury hasn&#8217;t seemed to  improve whatsoever and the Ravens are doing fine without him – their  problem is at QB not receiver. I shouldn&#8217;t be so harsh though&#8230; at  least she&#8217;s no longer carrying any guys on IR, and didn&#8217;t start any bye  week players. And with Roddy White, Michael Turner and maybe LeGarrette  Blount coming back next week, she has a definite chance to notch a W  next week. As for AJ&#8217;s team this week, two words: Cam Newton! He&#8217;s the  real deal. At this point, he&#8217;s probably the best free agent pickup in  the last few years. I mean, he&#8217;s fully ensconced in the top tier of QBs –  plus his team often plays from behind so he&#8217;s gotta air it out. Perfect  fantasy situation! Plus Nate Washington is finally paying dividends and  he&#8217;ll likely continue to do so if Hasselbeck avoids sliding back in to  earlier slump. Anquan Boldin finally found some spark with Flacco this  week, helping the Ravens narrowly avoid an embarrassing loss to the  Cardinals. And Greg Olson is benefitting from Cam&#8217;s chemistry with his  tight ends (he also threw a TD to Jeremy Shockey this week) and the  double-dip points here are going to be increasingly valuable. AJ&#8217;s  biggest worry (besides Cam&#8217;s impending bye week) has gotta be injuries  as his bench looks pretty dismal.</span><span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>SPAU 114 (3-4-1); BREH 85 (5-3)</span></strong><br/><span>Andre  rode the Lions to victory. Its that simple. Matt Stafford continued his  reign of terror as the Lions came in to Denver hungry to stop their two  game skid. They beat the shit out of the Broncos on both sides of the  ball – Stafford had 30 fantasy points while the Lions D/ST piled up 28  of their own. Seven of those came from sacking Tebow. Surprise  performances from Eric Decker and Josh Cribbs put this one way over the  top. As for Pat, he simply can&#8217;t win if all three of his star receivers  don&#8217;t hit double digits. Megatron came through with a cool 18 and Vick  lit up the Cowboys for 28, but Wes Welker and Dez Bryant combined for an  awful 5 points. In fact, his six players besides Vick, Calvin Johnson  and the Titans D/ST (playing Indy&#8230;) totaled just 22. Going in to this  game it looked like Megatron might negate the Stafford surge by having  their TD hookups cancel out, but each of Stafford&#8217;s 3 TD passes went to a  different receiver. And with Pittsburgh stifling the Patriots the  entire game, and Romo inexplicably looking to Laruent Robinson instead  of Bryant (or Miles Austin for that matter), this one was over pretty  damn quick.</span></p>
