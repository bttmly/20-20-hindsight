    <p class="body-copy">Before looking back (week 13 recap to follow), let&#8217;s look ahead. Each playoff team has strengths as well as weaknesses. But with most of these teams it&#8217;s fairly easy to pick out one or two players that will have a disproportionate impact on that team&#8217;s success (or failure) in the postseason. First off, it should go without saying that the most important player on any squad is the quarterback. With the exception of Peyton Manning, seven of the top eight QBs are represented on a playoff roster. Obviously a stellar or awful week from a quarterback can decide a matchup single-handedly. This list tries to examine non-QB players that can swing the games.</p>

<h3>Nick</h3>
<p><strong>QB: Matt Ryan</strong></p>
<p><strong>Swing players: Bryce Brown, Julio Jones</strong></p>
<p class="body-copy">Bryce Brown has been absolutely stunning in his first two pro starts. He has <em>50</em> combined fantasy points over the last two weeks with four touchdowns and 372 scrimmage yards on just 51 total touches. But there&#8217;s a big red flag here: fumbles. He&#8217;s lost three in just two games, including a back-breaking turnover late in the Philly-Dallas Sunday night tilt. Further, LeSean McCoy is steadily progressing through his concussion rehab. Still, Brown&#8217;s talent is so dazzling the Eagles naturally want to see more of him, and with a losing season already in the books there&#8217;s no need to rush McCoy back. On the other hand, I&#8217;m not sure who they have behind him on the depth chart but three fumbles in two games would earn most backs a spot squarely in the doghouse.</p>
<p class="body-copy">When Julio Jones is great, he&#8217;s spectacular. And when he&#8217;s not, he&#8217;s extremely mediocre. I&#8217;m no film expert, but given the ups and downs of Julio, Roddy White, and Tony Gonzalez, it seems that Matt Ryan basically takes what the defense gives him. In their game plans Atlanta&#8217;s opponents are forced to choose which of Jones or White they&#8217;ll focus on, and Matty Ice is willing and able to beat them with the other one. If it happens to be Jones, that&#8217;ll be great for me (especially since I&#8217;ll be double-dipping on TDs). If not, I&#8217;m in trouble.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Another thing that has been unsettling is Arian Foster&#8217;s diminishing workload. As the 11-1 Texans look to the playoffs, Arian Foster&#8217;s workload has taken a downturn. The outcome of their week 14 matchup with New England will be crucial: if Houston wins they put a stranglehold on the AFC and (nearly) secure home field throughout the playoffs. With nothing left to play for, it&#8217;s conceivable that they split the workload between Foster, Ben Tate, and Justin Forsett (all three of whom are on my roster now, by the way). Still, it&#8217;d be nearly impossible to bench Foster even if he&#8217;s getting just 12-15 carries. But if the Pats knock off the Texans, Houston will likely need to keep their foot on the gas, which hopefully means more work for Foster down the stretch. Over in the NFC, the Falcons hold a 2.5 lead over the Niners for the top seed in the conference. I think it&#8217;s fairly unlikely that they sit Matt Ryan and/or Julio Jones towards the end of the season, but it&#8217;s a possibility. Hopefully my fantasy season doesn&#8217;t hinge on the amount these guys see the field</p>

<h3>Zak</h3>
<p><strong>QB: Drew Brees</strong></p>
<p><strong>Swing players: Chris Johnson, Demaryius Thomas</strong></p>
<p class="body-copy">The acquisition of Chris Johnson was instrumental in Zak securing the top seed. Prior to an understandable, but still underwhelming, four-point stinker against Houston, Johnson had six straight double-digit games including three games topping 120 rushing yards. Zak will be off week 14 when CJ goes against the soft Indy run defense, but in week 15 he&#8217;ll have an even better matchup against the Jets. Should Zak make the championship game Johnson will face the Green Bay, whose run stop unit is just about league average.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Demaryius Thomas has had a bonkers year, clocking in under double-digits just four times all season, and in three of those four he scored at least seven points. With Eric Decker flagging lately Thomas has been picking up the slack, with a four game streak of double-digit performances and four touchdowns over that span. He goes against the decent Baltimore secondary in week 15, then against the awful Browns the following week.</p>
    
<h3>Hooper</h3>    
<p><strong>QB: Aaron Rodgers</strong></p>
<p><strong>Swing players: Adrian Peterson, Frank Gore</strong></p>
<p class="body-copy">First, I&#8217;d like to congradulate Hoop on an ingenous move that, unfortunately, he won&#8217;t get to benefit from. Looking forward at his schedule he noticed his Houston D/ST would be up against the Patriots the week of the first round of the fantasy playoffs. So he picked up the Browns D/ST which will be playing the Chiefs this week. Defenses playing the Chiefs have averaged a staggering 17.3 FP (league worst). Defenses against the Patriots? Averaging -0.9 FP (league best). Hoop earned a first round bye, and so will not be playing at all this week. Still, tip of the hat for forward thinking.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Adrian Peterson is third among RBs and scoring, and were it not for Doug Martin&#8217;s 83 points over weeks eight and nine, Peterson would be behind only Arian Foster. While he started the season much stronger than expected, he&#8217;s actually improved as the season has gone on rather than wearing down. He&#8217;s scored 20+ in four of his last six outings! With Hoop on bye, he&#8217;ll avoid AP&#8217;s matchup with the formidable Bears defense (2nd in RB points against). The Vikings get the soft Rams in week 15, followed by the stout Texans the following week. If AP tears apart the Rams, which he should, Hoop will be in great shape. If Hoop makes the championship, AP&#8217;s performance against one of the league&#8217;s best run defenses could largely determine the outcome.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Frank Gore has been astonishing this year. Towards the end of last year he looked worn out and, at times, simply ineffective. The Niners have managed his snaps a little this year, giving some work to Kendall Hunter, but overall Gore just seems to be in great shape. He&#8217;s currently ninth among RBs in fantasy points, and he&#8217;s been a critical part of Hoops top-scoring squad. But over the three weeks of playoffs Gore has matchups with the 7th (Miami), 6th (New England), and 5th (Seattle) best run defenses. How he fares in these games will be crucial.</p>

<h3>Dave</h3>    
<p><strong>QB: Robert Griffin III</strong></p>
<p><strong>Swing players: Stevan Ridley, Bears D/ST</strong></p>
Stevan Ridley has been sensational this year and is currently tied for fifth among RBs in points. Co-incidentally, he&#8217;s tied with Dave&#8217;s other stud RB, Trent Richardson. But back to Ridley. He&#8217;s playing against Houston and San Francisco in the first two playoff weeks, two hellacious run defenses. If Ridley can put together decent performances, Dave will be well positioned to make a deep run. Otherwise, he might be sitting on a painful roster hole during the playoffs.
The Chicago defense has scored 208 points this season. For comparison, Arian Foster, the top scoring RB, has 191. So yeah, saying they&#8217;ve been ridiculous is an understatement. But while they haven&#8217;t exactly dropped off recently, they&#8217;ve certainly come down a little. While they did put up 18 against Minnesota two weeks ago, that game was bracketed by a -1 FP outing against San Francisco, and a 4 FP losing effort against Seattle this week. They have interesting matchups with the Vikings and Packers over the next two weeks. But if Dave makes it to the championship they could hand him the title; the Bears travel to Arizona week 16 to play the Cardinals who are 30th in points allowed versus defenses.

<h3>Phil</h3>    
<p><strong>QB: Tom Brady</strong></p>
<p><strong>Swing players: Aaron Hernandez, Greg Jennings</strong></p>
<p class="body-copy">At first blush Phil&#8217;s team does not look like a playoff roster. His starting RBs are a pair of plodding bruisers – Mikel Leshoure and Steven Jackson – and he&#8217;s got Stevie Johnson and Denario Alexander at receiver. Aside from Brady, nobody he started last week would be taken in the top four or five rounds if we redrafted today. And yet he managed this bunch of misfits well enough to punch a ticket to the dance. Still, he&#8217;s averaging just 87.7 points per week which won&#8217;t get him far in the playoffs.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Phil&#8217;s second round pick, Greg Jennings, has been out with a groin injury for most of the season. After missing seven weeks he finally saw the field again on Sunday, grabbing four balls for 46 yards. While the Packers offense has been fine without him, he&#8217;s still clearly the top dog in the Green Bay receiving corps. Another interesting development: Jordy Nelson aggravated a hamstring injury last week and will likely miss Sunday&#8217;s contest with the Lions. Phil also happens to have Randall Cobb, who should be the second option in Green Bay after Jennings. While James Jones has been piling up the touchdowns, hampering his fellow receivers value, Jennings and Cobb are the ones you want to have. After a listless win over Minnesota, I&#8217;d expect Rodgers to come out firing against divisional foe Detroit. Cobb&#8217;s been great this season (14th among WRs); if Jennings can be productive without hurting Cobb&#8217;s numbers Phil&#8217;s team could be extremely dangerous. As an interesting sub-plot: given the bracket, Phil couldn&#8217;t play Hoop until the championship. But if he were to do so, the Jennings/Cobb combination would severely limit Aaron Rodgers&#8217;s effectiveness in the matchup.</p>
<p class="body-copy">While Gronk was the New England tight end that set all the records last year, and went on the infamous &#8220;Summer of Gronk&#8221;, it was Hernandez that had the football world excited. The Patriots locked him down through 2018 with a five-year extension, a move which seemingly indicated the team was ready to part ways with Wes Welker following the season. There were also reports out of camp of Hernandez being the focal point of the Patriots up-tempo attack, as his skill set allowed them to keep the full playbook open without changing personnel. Supposedly, in addition to his usual spot at tight end, he was working in the backfield as well as the slot. But like Jennings, Hernandez has been hampered by injuries this season, missing seven games so far. He&#8217;s back in the mix now, and with Gronk sidelined with a broken forearm he should get plenty of looks. But it&#8217;s fair to wonder if he&#8217;ll be as effective as he could be without Gronk there to draw attention away. But the upside here is huge, especially since Phil has Brady too.</p>

<h3>ZM</h3>
<p><strong>QB: Cam Newton</strong></p>
<p><strong>Swing players: WRs</strong></p>
<p class="body-copy">I&#8217;ll talk about ZM&#8217;s five-game winning streak that carried him into the playoffs in the recap post. But his season has been all about the receivers. He has Steve Smith and Mike Wallace, two of the best fantasy receivers last year. Both have been underwhelming this year; they&#8217;re 25th and 33rd in fantasy points among receivers respectively. He also has Andre Johnson and Vincent Jackson, two aging, formerly-elite receivers. Yet they&#8217;ve both had a renaissance of sorts this season. Incredibly, V-Jax is fifth in points at the position, while Johnson is ninth. Along with Cam Newton, these guys have carried ZM this year. His running back corps has been an absolute horror show. LeSean McCoy was less than advertised (and now he&#8217;s hurt, to boot), and the autodrafted Carolina tandem of Jonathan Stewart and DeAngelo Williams has been a disaster. ZM needs his receivers to deliver if he hopes to get out of the first round.</p>
