<p>Nick blew the draft with his first pick. Frankly so did everyone else with the exception of Zak going with Drew Breesus Christ (genius). Apparently no one got the memo - everyone draft a Quarterback first! Zak, we nailed it!</p>
<figure><img src="http://www.frodobooth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/50458.gif"/></figure><p>RB’s dropped off the table faster than the Eagles energy level after 3 quarters of offense under Chip “he eats like he coaches” Kelly. What’s that? A perfect lead-in to my critique of Nick’s first pick! <strong>LeSean McCoy</strong> (His mom made up his first name but didn’t stop there throwing in the Scottish surname “McCoy” to really confuse you) is going to fall apart from exhaustion and overuse within the first seven games. I chose seven so that by the time we’re mid-way through the season, and this hasn’t happened, you won’t remember I wrote it. Vick will fall apart relatively soon as well.</p>
<p>Side Note - Jenny, 1st pick A.J. Green... huh?</p>
<figure><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CD1exYt.gif"/></figure><p>When the draft swung back around Nick took <strong>Steven Jackson</strong>. My draft strategy this year was to go QB then gobble up whatever RBs were left on the board with my two back-to-back picks at 28/29. How did that work out for me? Brittle Bones Murray as my RB1 and a WR with my third pick. Set a game plan and watch it go.</p>

<figure><img src="http://www.frodobooth.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tumblr_mo8ypuOfdK1qdlh1io1_250.gif"/></figure><p>I’m starting to think the hours of preparation I put in before every draft might be a waste of time. <span> </span>I think Nick was upset that he ended up with Luck at QB in the third but for now he has two solid RB1s and I’m jealous. <span> </span>I probably wouldn’t have picked Jackson ahead of Forte but that’s a minor gripe. I think Jackson is old and his offensive line might struggle too often for him to meet his potential but that air attack in Atlanta is enough to keep defenses on their heels. At least you didn’t reach for David “Hot Potato” Wilson (I like Nicknames... long, super clever nicknames).</p>
<p>Nick chose <strong>Andrew Luck</strong> in round 3. Earlier in the week Nick made the astute observation that the top four teams in the playoffs last year had the top four QBs. The logical deduction then is that your best chance of making the playoffs this year (in a league that counts passing TD’s at 6 points) would be to draft a top notch QB, especially with 14 teams. It’s possible Luck has a great year but not likely given the following super objective observation - the guy’s last name is luck, and he didn’t save any of it for year two. Luck is coming up all dry heaves and constipated buttsola.</p>
<p><strong>Dwayne Bowe</strong> as your WR1 is dangerous. Alex Smith is a dink and dunker and I don’t think any wide receiver has ever truly excelled with Smith under center (again no actual research was done in the making of this post, that statement is based on passive/ mostly uninterested years of watching Smith with the niners).</p>
<p>Gronk with the next pick is another risky pick but Nick made up for it with <strong>Jordy Nelson </strong>the next round who I desperately wanted. I think Nelson will outplay Bowe by a sizeable margin and so if you just close your eyes and imagine those two picks swapped I don’t think Nick drafted poorly… and if you keep your eyes closed you can imagine that the rest of Nick’s draft was any good.</p>
<p>QB – C</p>
<p>RB – B+</p>
<p>WR – C</p>
<p>TE – B (I like the risk play, TEs are roughly all the same once the 2 or 3 elite ones are off the board)</p>
<p>K – Whatever (idiots draft kickers before the last round… like I did! I am an idiot)</p>
<p>D/ST – Who cares (Same goes with D/ST – draft late)</p>
