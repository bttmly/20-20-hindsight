<p class="lede">My five favorite teams coming out of the draft.</p>
<!--more-->
<!-- more -->
<p>Let me start by saying I&#8217;m not at all comfortable with both Brian and Max ending up in the top five. I wrote most of this before posting the second part of the draft report card but I already have some regrets. Here&#8217;s the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoRKjyVVVYxJdEJCUzg4WksxV1JRZU9VeGhUaUVDVFE&amp;usp=sharing">draft spreadsheet</a> for reference.</p>

    Good work. Now don&#8217;t fuck it up.

<p>
Check out Max&#8217;s receivers. That&#8217;s hands down, without a doubt, the best group of receivers you could possibly hope for&#8230; two seasons ago. Yeah, Welker was a beast against the Ravens but he&#8217;s also competing with Decker and the Thomases for passes. Julio Jones in season three could start to eclipse Roddy (who&#8217;s hurt right now by the way). Mike Wallace is catching balls from Tannehill these days instead of Roethlisberger. Greg Jennings made an even larger quarterback downgrade, going from Rodgers to Ponder. Hakeem Nicks can&#8217;t seem to stay healthy. That said, it&#8217;s clear all of these guys are elite talents and it&#8217;s likely that at least two of them have strong seasons. Max also has Cecil Shorts, who I think will have some monster games here and there. But Max drafted those receivers with six consecutive picks, leaving him very thin at running back; all he has in that department is Alfred Morris and three backups. On the other hand, he does have Tom Brady. I think this is a hilarious team for Max, given how petrified he is of making the wrong lineup choices. I can&#8217;t wait to see how many times Max loses matchups with benched receivers putting up monster numbers.

<h3 class="matchup-names">Zak</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Pass, TDs. Pass and TDs.</h6>
<p>
Keep in mind I&#8217;m trying to evaluate how things looked the morning after the draft, not the morning after week one. Anyway, Zak has hitched his wagon to Drew Brees for the second year in a row. The guy is an absolute stud and I think taking him fifth overall was a great selection. He&#8217;s been remarkably consistent and durable, with five straight seasons with 33 or more touchdowns and no games missed with injury over that stretch. Over his last two seasons he&#8217;s accounted for a staggering 91 scores, and with Sean Payton back after his season-long suspension the Saints will be playing with a gigantic chip on their shoulder. Add in a shaky defense that&#8217;ll force Brees to keep his foot on the gas and a surfeit of offensive weapons? We could be looking at a perfect storm of fantasy awesomeness. By doubling up with Jimmy Graham in the third Zak has a duo that with obscene upside. With his second and fourth round selections, Zak scooped up Stevan Ridley and Montee Ball. Again, remember that we&#8217;re trying to keep week one results out of the picture here. I liked both of these picks, although even at the time Montee Ball&#8217;s role was somewhat unclear. In rounds five through eight Zak went on a receiver shopping spree, picking up Antonio Brown, DeSean Jackson, Chris Givens, and Golden Tate. I have a soft spot for Brown but there are questions about how he&#8217;ll do as the top wideout in Pittsburgh. I love the Jackson pick – yes, I did even before the Eagles first game. Look, when a guy who has (very publicly) felt underused and a brand new head coach are raving about <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2013/09/06/philadelphia-wr-desean-jackson-expects-to-flourish-in-eagles-new-offense-under/">each</a> <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/philadelphia-eagles-desean-jackson-chip-kellys-ultimate-super-153000399.html">other</a>, take note. Jackson is great in space and can also stretch the field; I think you may have heard that Chip Kelly likes versatility. Chris Givens was another nice high-upside addition. The biggest question for Zak is how the Denver backfield will work out, and his thin depth at running back is worrisome. With all the high upside selections here, Zak has fully embraced the &#8220;championship or bust&#8221; mentality and I can&#8217;t fault him for that.

<h3 class="matchup-names">Brian</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Pass, TDs. Pass and TDs.</h6>
<p>
Brian was pleasantly surprised not to find himself in the first edition of the report card, but he shouldn&#8217;t have been. Aside from the gigantic reach on Janikowski his draft was pretty strong across the board. With his first four picks he snagged three starting running backs plus RG3. While two of those three backs, Lynch and Miller, struggled out of the gate in week one I expect them to be much better in general. Matt Forte had subpar rushing stats in week one (50 yards on 19 carries), but that was against the stout Bengals defenase and he still finished with 15. Selecting James Jones in the fifth was a reach with receivers like Mike Wallace, Hakeem Nicks, and Jordy Nelson still on the board; you may remember me singling out Jones as a lock to regress this season. Going with Pierre Garçon a round later was a nice high-upside move that could pay big dividends. Later selections like Brandon Myers and Brian Hartline look like steals a week in but I was high on them even before this weekend given that defenses will be focusing on other receivers on those teams. I also can&#8217;t argue with the backup QB selection given that RG3 is coming off a major knee injury. Obviously the Ravens defense was annihilated by the Broncos in the season opener but they won&#8217;t have to face Peyton at high altitude every week.

<h3 class="matchup-names">Paul</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Only Winners Get Wings</h6>
<p>
Very strong draft across the board for Paul. Were it me I would&#8217;ve gone with Alfred Morris over Trent Richardson but I can&#8217;t really fault the pick. Grabbing Calvin and Andre Johnson in the next two rounds was savvy, and Megatron especially I think was a steal at 19th overall. Again, my own preference would have been for another receiver available where Paul took Andre but it&#8217;s a fine pick. Right in the fourth and fifth rounds was where Paul really crushed it, opting to grab Reggie Bush in the fourth rather than panicking about being one of the last to grab a QB. Calling it now: Romo in the fifth was the steal of the draft. Now, fantasy football is about having fun more than anything, and unless you actually like the Cowboys there&#8217;s nothing fun about rooting for fucking Tony Romo. I think this explains, at least in part, why Romo fell so far. Under our scoring he was eighth at the position last season, ahead of guys like Russel Wilson, Andrew Luck, and Matt Stafford who were all gone by the end of the third round. Last point about Romo: he averaged 19 and change per game last season, about same as Kaepernick in his seven regular season starts. Paul doubled down on the Cowboys by snaring Jason Witten, another very nice pick. There is a big drop-off between the top tier of tight ends and the rest and being able to grab an excellent TE in the sixth is great. The next three tight ends off the board were Kyle Rudolph, Owen Daniels, and Greg Olsen, all of whom are significantly less valuable than Witten. Aside from Le&#8217;Veon Bell, Paul had some high upside picks on the back end including Kendall Wright, Jermichael Finley (another guy who fell too far becuase nobody likes him), and Danny Woodhead. If there&#8217;s a weakness here it&#8217;s that Paul isn&#8217;t very deep at any position so if one of his first five picks goes down he&#8217;ll be in bad shape. Overall though: nice work.

<h3 class="matchup-names">AJ</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">The Chesapeake Ripper</h6>
<p> Well here we are&#8230; my top graded draft. I graded AJ second overall last season and he rewarded me by finishing dead last. Don&#8217;t fuck me over again bro!</p>
<p>
I loved AJ&#8217;s draft for the most part. He ended up with <em>four</em> #1 running backs in Ray Rice, Chris Johnson, Daryl Richardson, and Bilal Powell. He secured a top-5 tight end in Vernon Davis. He snagged Kenbrell Thompkins and Ryan Broyles, two receivers with some hype coming out of the preseason and playing on offenses that will pile up points. And his receiving corps will be led by Randall Cobb, whose been getting rave reviews from his quarterback (some guy named Aaron Rodgers) for months. But&#8230; I hate his quarterback situation. Aside from ZM, who was autodrafting, AJ was the last to grab a starting QB, and he went with Michael Vick. In 10 seasons, Vick has played 16 games just once, and hasn&#8217;t played more than 13 since arriving in Philly. Now, there is obvious upside with this pick and I don&#8217;t hate it. I do think he should have gone after a backup earlier, specifically by spending his 10th round pick on Josh Freeman rather than the questionable Patriots defense. (I think Freeman is going to have a big year, just throwing that out there). If Vick misses more than two or three games AJ is going to be in big trouble unless he can upgrade from Cutler. Any word on when EJ Manuel is going to be healthy?
