<p>The adage &#8220;all press is good press&#8221; will be sorely put to the test over the next week as the NFL finds its officiating shitstorm (equivalent to a tropical storm, but with less rain and more shit) has become a full-blown Category 5 Clusterfuck (equivalent to a hurricane, but instead of high-speed winds it&#8217;s characterized by hysterical news coverage with flurries of expletive-laden tweets). <!-- more -->
The debacle in Seattle last night was a completely fitting conclusion for one of the NFL&#8217;s wierdest weeks in recent memory. The ineptitude of the replacement refs is the headline right now, but the NFL might actually be glad about it because Sunday was the worst day for headshots since week six back in 2010 which marked the beginning of the NFL&#8217;s ongoing crackdown on headhunting (remember <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztz1GjUylvU">this?</a>). <a href="http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/yahoo/carousel/embed_code.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=4f8dd8232ffa44de805967c14a562f5f">Matt Schaub</a>, <a href="http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/yahoo/carousel/embed_code.html?channelId=de89a8aeb3e422bac4eb48567f10ebd0&amp;channelListId&amp;mediaId=b5ebff53001840278a15c0f72a19cba8">Darrius Heyward-Bey</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwpmUbxUxe8">Deion Branch</a>, and Tony Romo all took brutal blows to the head on Sunday. DHB was carried off on a stretcher wearing a neck brace and Schaub lost a chunk of his left earlobe along with his helmet. The Cris Collinsworth/Al Michaels call on the Branch hit is classic (&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s not hearing an aviary in his head right now&#8221;) although the best part might be at 0:28 when Branch grins and gives Reed a respectful helmet-dap.</p>

<p>Anyway, the egregious call at the end of the Packers-Seahawks game focuses the discussion specifically on how the replacment officals are distorting the outcome of games with this one call serving as a rallying point. But this obscures a much larger point. As the more astute observers of the NFL have noted, saying refs aren&#8217;t impacting the outcome of games with bad calls just because those calls don&#8217;t come at the very end of the game is complete nonsense. The refs have been making bad calls the entire season and those calls have been affecting games already. From an NY Times article today referring to the blown calls on Sunday: &#8220;Luckily, none of those mistakes decided the game.&#8221; That should be &#8220;none of those mistakes <em>definitively</em> decided the game.&#8221; Yes, if you are on the business end of a bad call on a scoring play you would prefer if it happened early in the game so you have time to get those points back, but that blown call can still very much affect the outcome of the game because subsequent decisions are predicated on a game state that would not have existed had the correct call been made. Here&#8217;s a hypothetical example: Team A is down 10-3 to Team B early in the third quarter. Team B scores a touchdown on a play where the refs miss a blatant offensive pass interference call. Now Team A is down two touchdowns in the third quarter and both teams&#8217; decision-making processes change somewhat. Yes, there&#8217;s still plenty of time, but team A on offense might take a few more chances than they would have otherwise. Up 14 points, Team B&#8217;s pass-rush can pin their ears back and take more chances also. Now because certain plays, turnovers specifically, have such a collosal impact on the game this change in decision making process can be hugely magnified. Even if it translates in to just one more deep throw by Team A or one more blitz by Team B, if one of those plays results in a turnover (i.e. a deep pick or a strip-sack) then the orignial blown call becomes that much more important. These decision making adjustments aren&#8217;t apparent to most casual fans of the NFL, and writers tend to avoid these topics because they&#8217;re mushy &#8220;what-if&#8221; scenarios without clear answers. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t have a tangible impact on the game, even if it is impossible to quantify it exactly. (Aside: Bill Barnwell over on Grantland is one of the few people I&#8217;ve seen applying this kind of counterfactual reasoning, supported by statistics, to the NFL, although I haven&#8217;t seen him discuss the refereeing fiasco in these terms specifically. Nevertheless, his newly-renamed <a href="http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/38047/welcome-to-fourth-and-short"><em>Fourth-and-Short</em> column from Tuesday</a> about head coach decision making was pretty good. He does, however, seem to ignore the idea that coaching decisions might be changed by a different game state, especially in his <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8419209/the-niners-fall-rest-week-3-news">column from Monday</a>.)</p>
<p>The outpouring of rage has been incredible if not surprising. Every story on the front page of Deadspin at the moment is about the game and/or the refs. Here are some things that are going on: a Wisconsin state senator was so incensed he <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-roger-goodell-phone-number-20120925,0,6171890.story">tweeted Roger Goodell&#8217;s private office phone number</a>; another state senator, this time in New Jersey, <a href="http://deadspin.com/5946211/">introduced a bill</a> to ban the use of replacement officials in sporting events; Chris Kluwe, punter for Green Bay&#8217;s divisional rival Minnesota, <a href="http://deadspin.com/5946122/im-a-minnesota-viking-and-i-think-the-packers-got-screwed">supported the notion the Packers got robbed</a>; somewhere between <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8422934/seattle-seahawks-vs-green-bay-packers-disputed-mnf-call-shifted-150-250m-bets">$150 million and $1 billion</a> in betting action shifted due to the blown call; the NFL had to <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000066164/article/nfl-supports-decision-to-not-overturn-seahawks-touchdown?module=HP11_headline_stack">issue a statement</a> that the outcome of the game was final although the very same statement noted that there &#8220;should have been a penalty for offensive pass interference, which would have ended the game&#8221;; Packers players are understandably a <a href="http://deadspin.com/5946113/">little irritated</a>. My vote for <a href="http://larrybrownsports.com/football/tom-crabtree-compares-loss-to-dump-on-painting/155592">best tweet</a> goes to Green Bay tight end Tom Crabtree: &#8220;Imagine you make a painting. It isn&#8217;t perfect by others&#8217; standards, but it&#8217;s your painting. You are proud. Then someone takes a shit on it.&#8221; Yeah, that about sums it up. Even the title the media has given this fiasco, <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/sports/packers/171190081.html">"Golden Gate"</a> is horrible (Get it!? It&#8217;s a pun on the name of the receiver, Golden Tate, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scandals_with_%22-gate%22_suffix">-gate suffix</a> attached to every scandal since the 1970s, and also the name of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge">famous bridge</a> connecting San Francisco and Marin County. See? Genius. Or maybe it&#8217;s a more obscure reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge#Suicides">that thing</a> people do on the bridge, which is the same thing Packers fans might want the replacement refs and/or Roger Goodell to do. Either way.)</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just one game! There was a ton of other craziness this weekend in the NFL. On Sunday Night Football the Ravens rallied late to beat the Patriots on a controversial field goal. The Titans and Lions went to overtime on a deflected Hail Mary touchdown. The Cardinals are 3-0 and the Saints are 0-3. The Vikings knocked off the Niners despite Jim Harbaugh being awarded two challenges with no timeouts left. The Falcons obliterated the Chargers and the Giants likewise manhandled the Panthers. In fantasy, Aaron Rodgers has fewer points than Mark Sanchez, Jake Locker, and Christian Ponder to name a few. But he does have more than Cam Newton and Matt Stafford. Yikes. And, a late breaking development, Gregg Easterbrook <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/playbook/story/_/id/8421050/">is still a huge douche</a>.</p>
<h3>Jenny v. Hooper</h3>
<p><em>Still In 1st w a D on My Bench v. The Whole World is a Couch</em></p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve got Aaron Rodgers on your roster and a 13-point performance from Martellus Bennett sets the pace for your team you&#8217;re in for a beating. Besides Bennett, Antonio Brown was Hoop&#8217;s only other player to reach double digits. Frankly, aside from Ray Rice&#8217;s 20 FP nobody on either team was truly impressive. For Jenny, Eli posted a so-so 17 FP as the Giants did most of their scoring on the ground. Shonn Greene looks like one of the worst starting backs in the league with just 157 yards on 57 carries for a dismal 2.75 YPC, and Marques Colston has been struggling along with the entire Saints offense. Even Rob Gronkowski had a pedestrian outing as the Baltimore defense was able to largely contain him in Aaron Hernandez&#8217;s absense. On Hoop&#8217;s squad (yeah, the same one I ranked as strongest overall after the draft) things were even worse. Many expected Rodgers to regress a least a little from his sterling 2011 campaign, but the Packer offense has looked utterly limp so far this season. Maybe last night&#8217;s travesty lights a fire under the Packers. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Jenny 70 (3-0); Hooper 60 (1-2)</strong></p>
<h3>Zak v. ZM</h3>
<p><em>Chain Gang v. Orange County Gunners</em></p>
<p>Last year we had one matchup end in a tie and I promised we would have a tiebreaker of some kind this year. The options ESPN gives you for tiebreakers are &#8220;home team&#8221; wins, most QB points wins, most RB points wins, most WR points wins, and most bench points wins. The &#8220;home team&#8221; thing is completely arbitrary so that&#8217;s out and I see no compelling reason to give any one position more weight than the others. So that leaves bench points. Zak had one of those boom/bust days that can be a disaster. Drew Brees and Giants fill-in running back Andre Brown each piled up 24 points, and the Seahawks D/ST and Jared Cook contributed 13 each as well. But Demaryius Thomas and Kevin Smith each posted donuts and Jonathan Dwyer had -3 with a particularly ugly stat line: 3 carries, -1 yards, fumble lost. The decision to start Kevin Smith despite Mikel Leshore making his debut was perplexing, as was benching Welker when he was primed to resume his feature role in the offense with Hernandez out. But, he still got the win and that&#8217;s what matters. Obviously if he had made those adjustments it wouldn&#8217;t have been a tie, but he was able to squeeze a win out of those points anyway. For ZM this one has gotta hurt. Cam Newton turned in a paltry six points, largely thanks to the three picks he threw. LeSean McCoy continued to be a glaring draft mistake (remember, ZM took him first among RBs, fourth overall). Mike Wallace had a big day (18 FP) and Steve Smith and Fred Davis were both decent(ish). All in all, an 83 point outing is nothing to scoff at. But it looks like about the ceiling for ZM&#8217;s team, and near the floor for Zak. After all, Zak won the bench points battle 50-19 which decided the matchup.</p>
<p><strong>Zak 83 (2-1); ZM 83 (1-2)</strong></p>
<p><em>Zak wins on tiebreaker</em></p>
<h3>Brian v. Phil</h3>
<p><em>We Got Nicks Like Jesus v. The Bauce of Sauce</em></p>
<p>Goodness gracious. I suppose Big Ben has about one game a year like this, and Brian picked the right time to start him. He went off for 39 FP in a losing effort against the Raiders which spotted Brian a big lead he never gave up. His other guys piled on too: 17 from McFadden who looked very strong running the ball, 11 from CJ Spiller before he went down with a shoulder injury, and 20 from the ballhawking Falcons D/ST which recorded more takeaways (four) than points allowed (three) in a blowout in San Diego. Overall, seven of Brian&#8217;s nine starters recorded double-digit days while only two of Phil&#8217;s guys reached that mark. Brady was good-not-great in the Patriouts SNF loss to the Ravens (19 FP), and Stevie Johnson continued his scoring streak with seven grabs for 61 yards and a touchdown (12 FP). Other than that it was pretty ugly; out of the other seven starters only one exceeded five points, and that was kicker David Akers with six. The lone bright spot is Phil&#8217;s gamble on Mikel Leshoure looks like it might pay big dividends going forward. The Lions leaned heavily on Leshoure in his first pro game with 30 total offensive touches (26 carries, four catches) for 134 yards from scrimmage plus a score (19 FP). With that kind of production he&#8217;ll be a fixture in a Lions offense seeking to regain it&#8217;s 2011 potency, and Phil may have filled a big hole at RB1. Still, the loss of Hernandez really puts him in a tough spot and without some production from Steven Jackson and Greg Jennings he&#8217;ll continue to struggle.</p>
<p><strong>Brian 130 (2-1); Phil 52 (1-2)</strong></p>
<h3>AJ v. Max</h3>
<p><em>No Work Today v. Fuck You Aaron Sorkin</em></p>
<p>A zero-point outing from your quarterback will end in a loss damn near every time. Philip Rivers threw for 173 yards, 0 TD and two picks for a net-zero day which swamped Max&#8217;s chances early. Chris Johnson&#8217;s third straight terrible game only added insult to injury. The guy has 45 yards on 33 carries this season. Seriously. I predicted earlier that in 2012 we&#8217;d see more of the 2010 version Chris Johnson than the 2011 version. Boy was I wrong. The 2012 version is far, far, far worse than anything we saw last year. He started out badly in 2011 but still had 98 yards through three games which is more than twice what he&#8217;s registered this year. He&#8217;s somehow been more of a fantasy nightmare than Jamaal Charles last year, who went down with an ACL tear in week one. At least you could drop him with confidence; his season was over, your first round pick was squandered, but you could move on. Chris Johnson is far worse, because Max has to keep him, at least for another week or two. What a mess. With Matt Forte out at the moment Max&#8217;s team looks extremely vulnerable. Rivers (clearly!) hasn&#8217;t bounced back the way many predicted, and Brandon Marshall hasn&#8217;t had the elite output many expected from his reunion with Jay Cutler. Add in a worrisome injury to Reggie Bush and things look like they&#8217;ll get worse before they get better. AJ Green had a big day, but 13 of his 25 points came on a single trick play at the start of the game when he caught a 73-yard bomb out of a wildcat look from fellow receiver Mohammed Sanu. AJ&#8217;s team is tough to figure out, and without the consistency of a guy like Fred Jackson it&#8217;s hard to like this team as a consistent threat. Clearly Joe Flacco and Matt Schaub are both good quarterbacks; they had 30 and 32 respectively this week and each led their team to a hard-fought win. But they also have the two best running backs in the NFL on their teams, and when you&#8217;ve got a guy like Arian Foster or Ray Rice you just won&#8217;t throw as many touchdowns as a guy who absolutely needs to throw it to find the end zone (all things being equal). DeMarco Murray has been decent, but his YPC over the past two games has been remarkably low (around 2.75). Jacquizz Rodgers looks ready to breakout but those kind of receiving backs can be wildly inconsistent. Likewise with Brandon Lloyd who has caught 22 balls in three games but hasn&#8217;t found the end zone. His guys had a strong outing this week, but I really have no clue what to expect going forward. I guess I&#8217;ll find out this week since I&#8217;m facing off against AJ.</p>
<p><strong>AJ 97 (1-2); Max 60 (1-2)</strong></p>
<h3>Dave v. Pat</h3>
<p><em>That&#8217;s No Moon v. Town Taxes</em></p>
<p>I said above that getting zero points from your quarterback is almost a surefire loss. Well, the same thing applies to getting two points from your signal caller. Pat elected to start Tony Romo who turned it over three times. That&#8217;s -9 from his score, which was less than the margin of defeat. Ouch. On his bench Carson Palmer put up 23 and Andy Dalton posted 27; he&#8217;s already said he&#8217;ll be starting the Red Rocket next week but we&#8217;ll see if he sticks to that. Aside from Romo his team was pretty damn good. Alfred Morris has miraculously hung on to the starting running back job in Washington and put up 13 FP. Calvin Johnson had a 22-point outing and even the Jets D/ST pitched in with 13. Tony Gonzalez, the &#8220;ageless wonder&#8221; as ESPN has dubbed him, had 15 as well. But a crater at quarterback is all but impossible to overcome. For Dave, Matt Stafford had his best outing of the season so far (20 FP) but went down with a strained muscle in his leg. This will perhaps make the decision to start RG3, who is tied for Matt Ryan for most points by a quarterback, a lot easier. The biggest contributor on Dave&#8217;s squad was the Bears D/ST (25 FP) which absolutely hammered the Rams; they sacked Bradford six times and picked him off twice including a pick-six, while holding the Rams to just six points. Along with a nice contribution from Larry Fitzgerald (17 FP) Dave was up 16 heading into MNF and Marshawn Lynch was only able to tack on nine for Pat. But I do think Pat has the stronger team here, especially if he does move on from Romo. Dave has a big hole at tight end with Antonio Gates somewhat banged up, and after a big week one outing Stevan Ridley has been unreliable. He won&#8217;t be getting 25 from his D/ST spot again any time soon.</p>
<p><strong>Dave 100 (2-1); Pat 93 (1-2)</strong></p>
<h3>Ali v. Nick</h3>
<p><em>Chomo Se Dice: Bolsa de Bolsas v. Charlie&#8217;s $150 Dick Rash</em></p>
<p>Ugh. Scoring a bunch of points and losing sucks. Anyway, I had the misfortune of facing off against Ali when Jamaal Charles finally exploded. I mentioned in a previous post how Charles&#8217; elite speed and elusiveness have made him the <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rush_yds_per_att_career.htm">most efficient</a> running back in NFL history (the four guys ahead of him on that list are quarterbacks). He&#8217;s currently sporting a 6.0 YPC average on his career which is just staggering. Some (me included) were concerned he would lose some of that explosivness after his ACL tear but he looked as good as ever on Sunday, piling up 288 yards from scrimmage, including 233 rushing yards on 33 attempts (7.06 YPC), with two total touchdowns for 34 FP. Ouch. MJD also notched his best game of the season, going for 177 yards and a score in Jacksonville&#8217;s win over Indy. Bouncing back from a disastrous outing against the Falcons in week two Peyton Manning threw for 330 yards, 2 TD and no picks for 24 FP. Those three performances plus double-digit contributions from Denarius Moore and Vernon Davis put me in an extremely deep hole. On my team, Matt Ryan had another nice performance (26 FP) in the Falcons&#8217; win over the Chargers, throwing for three touchdowns for the second time in three games. Arian Foster and Julio Jones were good as usual, though neither had a monster game. The big surprise was Torrey Smith who exploded on Sunday night for 24 points on the same day he learned his younger brother had passed away in a motorcycle accident the night before, but there was no way he could close a 35-point gap by himself. Ryan Mathews was underwhelming in his season debut with just 4 FP. My gaping hole at tight end is becoming a serious issue, and I shot myself in the foot by falling asleep at 11&#160;pm last night and letting Kyle Rudolph slip through my fingers. Darn.</p>
<p><strong>Ali 122 (1-2); Nick 111 (2-1)</strong></p>
