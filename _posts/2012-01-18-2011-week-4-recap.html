<p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.7718683268749512">Here  we go. That time of the year where setting your lineup gets that much  harder, especially with a 12-team league. Its no longer &#8220;my team is a  little thin but my starters look real good.&#8221; Its now &#8220;<em>shit! I have to  start this guy???</em>" Taking a look around the league,  there is some big variation in how this will shake out in week 5. AJ  leads the pack with a whopping six guys with week 5 byes. Philly D,  Andre and myself each have five dudes with byes this week. On the other  hand, most people only have one or two players who will be watching  football on TV this week rather than playing it.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span></span><span>There  were a bunch of very solid performances this week, with fully half the  league breaking 100 points. In terms of standings, all three 3-0 teams  advanced to 4-0, while five of the 1-2 teams are now 1-3. Pat had  another strong showing but until Dave, Max or Philly D lose he won&#8217;t be  able to climb any higher. AJ and myself now sit at 2-2 while Jordan  wallows at 0-4.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>WILL  135 (4-0); MARC 96 (0-4)</span></strong><br/><span>Well  apparently Aaron Rodgers is good at football.  Anyway if somehow you haven&#8217;t heard this already here was Rodgers Sunday  performance: 4 pass TD, 2 run TD, 400+ air yards. Rodgers accounted for  nearly 40% of Dave&#8217;s score in this game. Besides which, his only roster  misstep was starting Hunter over Gore, although it was nice to see  these guys combine for 28 for the Niners. Jordan&#8217;s bounce back from the  miserable 51-point outing last week was outshined by the blinding  reflection off of Rodgers&#8217; championship belt. After the worst  performance of the season so far, Jordan put up 96 points despite having  [player#10452]AP[/player] stay in single digits. That would have been  enough to knock off five of the twelve teams this week, but simply not  good enough when Rodgers is out here accounting for six taters. Remind  anyone of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_-1XzvCILw&amp;feature=player_embedded">Vick vs. Washington last year</a>?</span><br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>BREH  132 (3-1); HUH? 88 (1-3)</span></strong><br/><span>Ali  shot himself in the foot once again by starting Ben  Roethlisberger, although having Hasselbeck instead wouldn&#8217;t have avoided this  44-point beating. Pat brought the big guns yet again this week (he  scored exactly 132 last week as well), with SIX  players getting 15 or more points. His remaining three starters combined  for 11 points. The obvious point to make here is the weakness of Pat&#8217;s  starting RBs, but with Wes Welker, Megatron, and [player#13215]Dez Bryant  at WR and Vick at QB, his team still looks like  the best in the league at this point. However, Vick and Bryant have both  gotten banged up this season so keep an eye on the injuries here.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>TWS  122 (4-0), LINC 106 (1-3)</span></strong><br/><span>If  Pat has the strongest team, Max is a close second. Rather than star  WRs, Max has three of the best RBs in the game this year. McFadden, Forte and a  now-healthy Foster have been the linchpin of  Max&#8217;s perfect-so-far season. The weaknesses here are inconsistent  receivers and quarterbacks. Though both Eli  Manning and Josh Freeman exceeded 20  this week, there will be times when neither breaks 15 (or even 12). Max  also has a weekly headache of trying to pick which two of his six  receivers will do OK. AJ Green looks to have locked up one spot but all  the others are erratic. Jenny&#8217;s team looked solid this week but didn&#8217;t  quite have the firepower to overcome Max&#8217;s three elite backs. She is  also now facing a tough QB choice, with Schaub&#8217;s  numbers likely to recede with Andre Johnson injured. However rival NFC  South running backs Michael Turner and LeGarrette Blount have been very solid and if  Jenny makes a mid-season surge, expect it to be largely due to these two  tanks.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>TUSK  113 (4-0); JUIC 109 (1-3)</span></strong><br/><span>ZM  came within four points of knocking Philly D off his undefeated perch,  but couldn&#8217;t quite make it. Phil&#8217;s team presented some very balanced  point production, with seven guys in double digits but none exceeding  20. ZM went the other way, benefitting from surprise week 4 studs Pierre Garcon (26) and Beanie  Wells (31), who was the highest scoring back in the league. A  few more moves would have won him the game; in fact just playing New  Orleans kicker Mike Kasay would have netted him an additional five and  the win. So in honor of this, ZM will be receiving our second 20/20  Hindsight Award. On another note, I was irritated to notice that Romo (on Phil&#8217;s bench) scored 25 points this week  despite giving away the actual, real football game. I wish there was a  way to punish QBs for pick-sixes above what they get docked for  interceptions.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>MS  86 (2-2); SPAU 71 (1-3)</span></strong><br/><span>AJ  pulled off a truly rare feat this week. He won despite his QB, all WRs,  and all RBs scoring single digits. I mean, none of them even got to 8  points. Luckily he had the Ravens D/ST to hold  him down. Racking up three defensive and special teams touchdowns, the  Ravens were simply awesome this weekend, at least when their offense was  off the field. Andre made the crucial error of staring the Steelers D/ST over the Lions (how did he end up with both by the way?), a  move which cost him 17 points and the win. I think at this point we can  agree that the Steelers D has fallen of substantially and that they  can&#8217;t be trusted until further notice. Cam  Newtonput up another big game (on the bench) with 33; so far  he has gone 33, 28, 16, and 33 and is the best free agent pickup this  season. The main bright spot for Andre was Eric  Decker&#8217;s 17; despite Brandon Lloyd returning, Decker still looks to be an important component of Denver&#8217;s  offense.</span><br/><span></span><br/><strong><span>DEM  73 (2-2); ZAK 71 (1-3)</span></strong><br/><span>This  week I again found myself in a stressful Monday night situation, this  time trying to defend a narrow lead rather than erase one. In week 3, I  entered Monday night down nine points to Max with Santana Moss to play.  Moss came up short by a pair and I went down 84-82. This week, I had  nobody to go on Monday and was up ten on Zak, but he had both Kellen  Winslow and Reggie Wayne to play. Ordinarily Reggie Wayne would be a  lock for the win but with Painter starting his first game it was a  tossup. The worst part was that he had a guy on each offense, so there  was the constant threat of a big play. Wayne and Winslow combined for  eight points and I narrowly squeaked out a win.</span></p>
