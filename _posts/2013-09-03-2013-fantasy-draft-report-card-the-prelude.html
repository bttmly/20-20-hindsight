Nick explains the thought process behind the upcoming draft report card.

<p>
This week I&#8217;ll be trying to churn out the annual draft report card. But before we get into that I&#8217;d like to provide some insight into my feelings about fantasy football draft strategy. If you disagree with me, great – submit something you lazy fuck.
</p>

<p>
Every season there are studs who come out of nowhere, can&#8217;t-miss guys who miss… badly, and horrific injuries that derail an otherwise hopeful fantasy season. Nobody can predict these, not with any real accuracy. But you can increase the chances that you stumble on the next breakout star. Likewise, you can limit your exposure to mega-busts. What&#8217;s important is the process, not the outcome; there&#8217;s just too much damn randomness. When it comes down to it, the single most important thing in fantasy football is luck.

<p>
Everyone wants to win the championship and that&#8217;s how I&#8217;m going to evaluate each person&#8217;s draft. It&#8217;s awfully hard to win the &#8216;ship by getting the &#8220;projected&#8221; value out of each draft pick. Generally the teams that do well have at least one guy who dramatically outperforms his preseason expectations. Last season featured surprise fantasy super-studs like Peyton Manning, Matt Ryan, and Doug Martin (all drafted in the fifth round in our league), RG3 (ninth), Bears defense (11th), and Alfred Morris (undrafted), among many other examples. 
</p>

<p>
I subscribe to the idea that you should minimize risk in the early rounds and load up on risk late. In practice, this means avoiding low-ceiling guys – veterans who we&#8217;ve seen play quite a bit, and who just aren&#8217;t great players. I&#8217;ll take a chance every single time on a talented but untested young player rather than draft someone like Shonn Greene. Even if Shonn Greene does end up having a better season than fresh faces like Christine Michael, Robert Woods, Jordan Cameron, or Jonathan Franklin… is he really going to carry you to a title? And even if Greene performs at his expected level, how often are you going to start him? On the other hand if Jonathan Franklin shakes off a dismal preseason and is sensational for the Packers, his value (along with some luck avoiding injuries) can propel you into the playoffs. 
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of &#8220;Greenes&#8221; and &#8220;Franklins&#8221; out there, and Greene-heavy teams are going to get crushed in these draft grades.
</p>

<h3>Scarcity</h3>
<p>
While high-risk / high-reward is my favored approach to the back end of the draft, scarcity is something important throughout. Sometimes there isn&#8217;t enough to go around, especially this year with 14 teams, and you don&#8217;t want to be the guy (or girl) with one running back after seven rounds. Each year it seems fewer NFL teams have a feature back that will carry the load, and those few that remain are the most precious resource in fantasy football. If you graph fantasy points against fantasy position rank you get a curve that shows the how quickly value falls off for a position. It makes intuitive sense that this would be steeper (i.e. fall off more quickly) for running backs than receivers, since teams often have three or four receivers on the field at once and just a single tailback. The upper echelon receivers don&#8217;t approach the fantasy value of the elite backs, but on the other end your WR4 may easily outscore your RB3. 
</p>

<p>
There is also roster scarcity to consider. When I discussed lottery tickets above I was talking specifically about skill positions. In our league this season you can start up to three running backs, three tight ends, or four receivers in a given week. This means if you hit on a lottery ticket, there are a whole bunch of guys you can potentially bump to the bench. On the other hand, if you strike gold on a second quarterback (or, God forbid, a defense) it has to be clearly better than your starter. A great example of this was Dave last season. He went with Stafford sixth overall then picked up RG3 in the middle of the ninth round, and it took him something like 10 weeks to start RG3 on a consistent basis. If a similar situation popped up with a receiver or running back you could simply bench your worst guy skill position guy and ride the wave. With a QB, the difference between your number one guy and your emerging lottery ticket is likely to be much smaller since there’s only one person he could possibly replace – your current starting QB. The average team in our league this season drafted 10.25 skill position players with six starting spots for those guys. If one of your lottery ticket hits you can easily find a place to insert him into your starting lineup, and the difference between him and your worst skill position guy is likely to be pretty significant.
</p>

<p>
The other argument against backup QBs if you spend a high pick on a elite signal caller and he gets hurt, you&#8217;re basically fucked anyway. Do you really think the fact that you have Sam Bradford as your backup is going to salvage your season? You just have to gamble that he won&#8217;t get hurt. Use that roster spot on another lottery ticket. Really, this goes for tight ends too; there are a lot of average tight ends. If you have one as your starter and he gets hurt, pick up another. If you have Jimmy Graham though and he goes down, well, better luck next year. Backing him up with Martellus Bennett isn&#8217;t going to make much of a difference. (To be clear, this is hypothetical. Zak has Graham and no backup TE).

<h3>Last Season&#8217;s Outliers</h3>
<p>
Chasing last year&#8217;s stats is a loser&#8217;s game. Anytime someone has a freakish number of touchdowns or ludicrous yardage totals it’s wise to steer clear since someone else will probably draft him ten spots too high. A serious red flag is a bizarre number of touchdowns, especially for receivers. Remember Dwayne Bowe&#8217;s 2010 campaign with <em>15</em> touchdowns? He followed that up with five scores in 2011 and just three in 2012. Or Jordy Nelson in 2011, also with 15 scores (and over 1200 yards)? Last year: just 7 end zone trips and 745 receiving yards, while all those touchdowns went to James Jones, who inexplicably had 14 on just 64 receptions (better than 1-in-5). This goes in the other direction too. How about the oft-repeated observation that Calvin Johnson was tackled <em>five times</em> at the <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/57781/inside-the-lions-td-dropoff-in-2012">1-yard line</a>, and eight times total within the 5-yard line. Do you think that&#8217;s likely to happen again? All of this is to demonstrate that touchdowns are awfully hard to predict. It&#8217;s a little easier for running backs but even there you&#8217;ll have weird situations like LeSean McCoy following up 20 total touchdowns in his 2011 campaign with just five last season. Avoid outliers – they&#8217;re always more likely to burn you than to repeat. 
</p>

<p>
There&#8217;s a corollary to this: take a good look at guys who posted mysteriously low touchdown totals last season. They&#8217;re likely to regress to the mean, which is a positive in this case.
</p>

<p>
D/ST outliers are especially noticeable. There are a few reasons why defense and special teams units are so volatile, but the biggest one is turnovers and defensive touchdowns. Take the absurd 2012 Chicago Bears, where their defense scored <em>10</em> touchdowns, the highest figure by any team since 1998. Or take a glance at the 2011 Niners and Packers, who were tied for the league lead in takeaways with 38 each. In 2012 they dropped down to 25 and 23 respectively; the league average that season was 24.9 takeaways. Even team sack totals bounce around; Philly went from a league-leading 50 sacks in 2011 to just 30 (T-25th) last year. Green Bay went the other direction, from 29 (T-27th) to 47 (4th) over the same span. 
</p>

<p>
Please remember, I&#8217;m not making predictions about what <em>will</em> happen. I&#8217;m trying to figure out what is most likely to happen based on past trends. Am I trying to say that Adrian Peterson and Calvin Johnson aren&#8217;t once-in-a-generation talents? Hell no. Am I trying to say they are subject to the laws of <a href="http://img.pandawhale.com/67359-yeah-science-gif-TZdX.gif">physics, biology, and probability</a>, just like everyone else? Yes I certainly am.
