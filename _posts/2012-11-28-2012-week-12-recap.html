    <p class="body-copy intro">With the playoffs looming, the matchups this week didn&#8217;t offer a lot of clarity going forward. I&#8217;ll write a little more tomorrow about how things could shake out, including taking a look at the tie-breakers. In the meantime, enjoy the week 12 recaps.</p>

		<p class="body-copy">It certainly looked like Eli enjoyed his week off. He bounced back with a strong fantasy day (28 FP), although some of the underlying numbers were less than stellar (53.3% comp., 249 yds.). Ray Rice and the Baltimore defense each contributed double-digits, 15 and 11 respectively, but nobody else did. Shonn Greene (4 FP) posted his seventh game of the season with six or fewer fantasy points. Hot free agent pickup Jalen Parmele also managed just 4 FP before exiting with a season-ending groin injury while Miles Austin also suffered an injury and registered a donut. Marques Colston did find the end zone, but the Niners focused on shutting him down and he was held to 36 yards on four catches (9 FP). While her starters this week were underwhelming, Jenny may be able to turn to her bench for some help reaching the playoffs. Beanie Wells had 16 FP in his first game back and he figures to get more work going forward as the quarterback situation in Arizona is a disaster. On the other hand, the two touchdowns were nice but he gained just 48 yards on 17 carries (2.8 avg) against a Rams defense that has allowed 4.1 yards per carry on the season. But as long as Ryan Lindley is throwing the ball Wells will be the Cardinals&#8217; best scoring option. Bilal Powell notched his second straight double-digit outing, although actually that might not be good news for Jenny since she has Shonn Greene also.</p>
        <p class="body-copy"><a href="http://">Last week I discussed in detail</a> the tough luck AJ has had this season. I don&#8217;t have too much more to say about it, except to note that a few of the pre- and early-season buzz guys have started to come on strong lately, particularly Jacquizz Rodgers and Brandon LaFell. Unfortunately (and obviously), they&#8217;re far too late to help AJ and they were on the bench anyway. Also, BenJarvus Green-Ellis finally has two solid games back-to-back. AJ is very happy this is not (yet) a keeper league.</p>

		<p class="body-copy">After suffering an embarassing 42-130 blowout at the hands of ZM last week (the score was adjusted slightly) by team bounced back spectacularly. While Matt Ryan was a little worse than expected, especially against Tampa Bay&#8217;s pass defense which allows more yards per game than <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/receiving/sort/receivingYardsPerGame/position/defense/order/false">any other team in the league</a>, almost everybody else was stellar. Julio Jones (20 FP) set a career high with 147 receiving yards, 80 of which came on a bomb from Matty Ice. That single throw was worth 23 FP to my team (9 for Ryan, 14 for Jones). After two season firsts last week – fumbling and failing to score – Arian Foster came back with his best fantasy outing of the year. He took his 20 carries for 102 yards and a pair of scores while also catching five balls for 15 yards (23 FP). Cecil Shorts also had a big day, taking his four catches for 105 yards and a score (16 FP). But my highest scorer was the vaunted (not vaunted) Rams D/ST. This unit has been all over the map this year, with three 15+ FP performances but also a bunch of stinkers against decent offenses, and averaging 6.4 FP per game. A Ryan Lindley-led offense, however, is not decent. He threw four picks on Sunday, two of which were returned for touchdowns, and the St. Louis D/ST finished with a Bears-like 29 FP. My second-best performer was actually on my bench – Bryce Brown. Brown, playing in place of the injured LeSean McCoy, racked up an incredible 24 FP despite losing <em>two</em> fumbles. The fact he didn&#8217;t seem to secure the ball even after fumbling twice was worrisome but he represents some nice upside going into the playoffs, especially as my once-deep running back corps has thinned out considerably.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Check this out: Pat, now 4-8, has the exact same number of total points this season as Zak, who&#8217;s leading the league at 9-3. He&#8217;s lost matchups by margins of 7, 6, 5, and 1. He&#8217;s also lost four times while scoring over 90 points. That blows. His team has been fairly strong all year but Calvin Johnson&#8217;s slow start really hurt him. Over his first seven games Megatron averaged 9.5 FP per week, but has surged lately with an 18 FP average over the last four. Pat also made a midseason QB change from Romo to Dalton, which has substantially improved his team. Romo is 15th among QBs in points while Dalton is (shockingly) seventh. Unfortunately, Alfred Morris, Tony Gonzalez, and Roddy White have all tailed off a little over the past few weeks after torrid starts. Pat&#8217;s team hasn&#8217;t really had a period this year where his team was firing on all cylinders. I&#8217;ll write a post after the season to examine how lucky (or unlucky) each team was, but I&#8217;d be shocked if Pat isn&#8217;t the unluckiest. (I did this last season too but I can&#8217;t find the post&#8230; you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoRKjyVVVYxJdFZnQmxiVU1SS09ZN0NLQ0VEaWlfeEE">check out the spreadsheet</a> though. See header comments for explanation.)</p>

	</div>

		<p class="body-copy">Max left a boatload of points on the bench in a crucial matchup for his playoff hopes, but his decision-making process was pretty sound. It&#8217;s just one of those fucked up fantasy football things. He couldn&#8217;t have known Matt Forte would get injured after scoring just one FP&#8230; nor that Michael Bush would rack up 18 FP in relief. He couldn&#8217;t have known that Pierre Garcon (15 FP) - in his first game back after six weeks out with injury, no less - would score more than AJ Green (#1 fantasy WR, 13 FP) or Brandon Marshall (#2 fantasy WR, 10 FP). He couldn&#8217;t have known that Dustin Keller (#25 TE, 12 FP) would outscore Greg Olsen (#9 TE, 5 FP), or that Philip Rivers (#21 QB, 15 FP) would outscore Carson Palmer (#12 QB, 5 FP). The only real blunder was going with Vick Ballard over Reggie Bush and even that one is somewhat defensible - Bush had 5 FP or fewer in four of his previous five outings. Nope, he couldn&#8217;t have predicted any of that. But it sucks when your bench outscores your team.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">ZM got 89 FP - 80% of his total - from three guys. Andre Johnson had 18, his second best score of the season. The Patriots D/ST had a bonkers 30 FP for the <em>second straight week</em>. And Cam Newton racked up 41 FP, the best fantasy performance of the week by a healthy margin. Everyone else he started was pretty terrible, including four guys with three or fewer FP. But his big performers bailed him out and he won big anyway.</p>

        <span class="matchup-names">Dave v. Hoop</span>
        <span class="matchup-teams">THAT&#8217;S NO MOON v. THE WHOLE WORLD IS A COUCH</span>
	</div>
	<div class="clear"></div>
    
		<p class="body-copy">Dave&#8217;s team is looking downright fearsome. His 47-point head-scratcher last week aside, he&#8217;s been great this year. In fact, he&#8217;s been a lot better than his 7-5 record might suggest, considering he&#8217;s lost matchups while scoring 105, 112, and 114 points. Aside from that 47 last week, he had one other down week with 60. Every other matchup he&#8217;s scored over 90 points, and he&#8217;s reached triple digits eight times. Two unlikely contributors have carried him for most of the season: RG3 and the Bears D/ST. The rookie QB&#8217;s fantasy dominance is unprecedented. He&#8217;s currently the #3 scoring QB and he&#8217;s scored 20+ in eight of his 11 outings this season, and 30+ in four including 35 and 40 in his last two. Dave drafted him in the <em>ninth round</em>. The Bears D/ST has been just incredible as well. They&#8217;re averaging 18.9 FP per game! For a defense! That&#8217;s more than any RB or WR, and #10 among all players. That was his <em>eleventh</em> round pick. He also has Stevan Ridley and Trent Richardson who are both having great years.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">When Rodgers and AP both have down weeks, Hoop needs a colossal game from somebody else. Doug Martin was great with 18 FP and Frank Gore had a very nice 15 FP, but nobody had the kind of silly three TD game that might have bailed him out. He&#8217;s still in position to take one of the first-round byes but a win here would have essentially sealed the deal. More on this tomorrow.</p>

        <span class="matchup-names">PHIL v. ALI</span>
        <span class="matchup-teams">THE BAUCE OF SAUCE v. SALSA CON QUESO</span>
	</div>
	<div class="clear"></div>
    
		<p class="body-copy">Pretty typical game for Phil: a big game from Brady, another strong performance (Niners D/ST this week) and a handful of decent outings (Steven Jackson, Mikel Leshoure, and Stevie Johnson). He should make the playoffs but if he can&#8217;t string together some more convincing performances he won&#8217;t go far. It&#8217;s certainly possible; guys like Aaron Hernandez, Randall Cobb, and Danario Alexander all have major upside potential.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Ugh, what a disappointing matchup for Ali. It was a big opportunity - he could&#8217;ve pulled even with Phil and the other 6-6 playoff hopefuls, ZM and Jenny. But a lot of guys on his team have been in a slide lately, and this week it came to a head. Denarius Moore and Mike Williams got hot in the middle of the season but have cooled off since then. Vernon Davis and Victor Cruz got off to strong starts but have been mostly disappointing lately. Peyton Manning can&#8217;t carry the load by himself.</p>
		<p class="scoreboard">Phil 113 (7-5); Ali 64 (5-7)</p>
		<hr class="style-eight"><div>
        <span class="matchup-names">Zak v. Brian</span>
        <span class="matchup-teams">BREES CAN&#8217;T SING BUT HE CAN BALL v. PASS, TDS. PASS AND TDS.</span>
	</div>
	<div class="clear"></div>
    
		<p class="body-copy">With his fourth straight win Zak moved into sole possession of first place and has the inside track on the top playoff seed. Brees had his third-straight 20+ outing and eighth of the season, while Chris Johnson, Wes Welker, Demaryius Thomas, and Jermaine Gresham all chipped in double-digit days. With a handful of studs and solid guys everywhere else, Zak is right where he wants to be. He also has Shane Vereen, with two straight games with double-digit carries, and Knowshon Moreno, who has snapped up the starting job in Denver, on the bench.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">This was a rough one for Brian. While his two Giants stars combined for 30 FP, Josh Freeman scored only 10 FP after six striaght 20+ outings. C.J. Spiller had 10, but all the rest managed six FP or fewer. I guess on the bright side he set as good of a lineup as he could considering nobody on his bench did better than three. Blah.</p>
