<p>For your reading pleasure, I&#8217;m proud to present the first installment of the 2013 fantasy draft report card. Read on to find out which four drafts I liked least, starting with the utterly miserable and progressing to the sort of terrible.</p>

<p>
For reference you can find a spreadsheet of our league&#8217;s draft picks <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoRKjyVVVYxJdEJCUzg4WksxV1JRZU9VeGhUaUVDVFE#gid=0">here</a>.

    You&#8217;re goddamn right it&#8217;s my opinion.

  I&#8217;ll try and be as charitable as possible and just start with this: Justin&#8217;s fantasy football philosophy is very different from mine. I think he&#8217;s pretty happy with his draft, so good for him. But from my point of view, given what I said in the <a href="http://20-20hindsight.tumblr.com/2013/09/03/2013-fantasy-draft-report-card-the-prelude.html">prelude post</a>, his draft was a catastrophe of epic proportions. He started off by selecting Doug Martin over Adrian Peterson with the second overall pick. Now, paraphrasing what Justin told me yesterday, he feels that &#8220;results are the only thing that matters.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t disagree more. Sure, it&#8217;s possible that Martin has a better season than Peterson. But is it likely? Was there a sound process behind the decision? I would have to argue no. There&#8217;s no &#8220;sure thing&#8221; in fantasy football but given AP&#8217;s track record he&#8217;s the closest there is. Further, Martin&#8217;s spectacular rookie season was powered by some long runs that are unlikely to repeat so Justin is definitely chasing an outlier here. Just for reference, 17% of Martin&#8217;s season rushing yards and 36% of his season rushing touchdowns came in a <em>single game</em> against the god-awful Raiders defense. If you take out that game and prorate his stats on a per-game basis he would have averaged 80 yards rushing and 0.46 rushing touchdowns per game. Last points: he only had five games last season where he ran for 100+ yards, and besides Arian Foster had the lowest YPC of any top-tier back. Moving on now. Besides Martin, Justin only drafted two other running backs, neither of which is a starter – this is that scarcity thing I was talking about. He also piled up his mid-round picks and set them on fire, with a defense in the fourth, a backup QB in the seventh and a fucking <em>kicker</em> in the eighth. Sure, the Niners defense is going to be great, but there were so many higher-value guys available, including Gio Bernard and Ahmad Bradshaw who came off with the next two picks. Hilariously, Justin drafted Bradshaw&#8217;s backup, Vick Ballard, one pick after that. The backup QB in the seventh, especially with a top-five guy like Cam already on the roster, is just silly. Finally, he went chasing an outlier again with kicker Blair Walsh. You already know my feelings on this but <a href="http://www.faketeams.com/2013/8/9/4603752/fantasy-football-fools-drafting-kicker">here&#8217;s a good read</a> on that topic. Just piling on, but he also picked up a backup <em>defense</em> later on. 
</p>
<p><em>Note: Yes, I do realize that by writing all this I&#8217;ve all but guaranteed that Justin will somehow go undefeated.</em></p>
<p class="score text-big">Draft Grade: F</p>

<h3 class="matchup-names">Jenny</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Niner Faithful</h6>
<p>
 I think this team is a disaster (no offense). Besides AJ Green and Peyton Manning I&#8217;m not excited about a single player on this squad. Jenny has basically one real running back, Eddie Lacy. We&#8217;ll see how Mendenhall does but my expectations are very low. Marques Colston is a stud but is also incredibly inconsistent. Greg Olsen is mediocre; you&#8217;d be hard pressed to find another tight end do so little with so many targets. The Seahawks D/ST will be good, and even if they allow more points and generate fewer takeaways than a year ago they&#8217;ll probably produce more touchdowns than the three they scored last season. Other things I dislike: drafting a kicker in the 11th, drafting Roy Helu at all, Santana Moss.
</p>
<p><em>Note: I wrote this before the season opener. Peyton is currently on pace for 112 touchdowns this season – hey, maybe Jenny has a shot!</em></p>
<p><em>Another note: Dave pointed out to me that Jenny drafted AJ Green ahead of Calvin Johnson. Ditto my earlier point about Doug Martin / Adrian Peterson.</em></p>
<p class="score text-big">Draft Grade: D-</p>

<h3 class="matchup-names">Ali</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Chomo Se Dice: Salsa Con Queso</h6>
<p>
I&#8217;m not sure if Ali was even really trying. His team looks pretty awful and there isn&#8217;t really a plan here – he only drafted two receivers for Christ&#8217;s sake. For what it&#8217;s worth, I mentioned this to him on Thursday night and he seemed shocked. In the report card prelude I used Shonn Greene to exemplify the kind of low-ceiling player you should avoid late in drafts. Yeah, he&#8217;s on Ali&#8217;s team. I think DeAngelo Williams will be pretty good, as will Sproles and Gonzalez, and if everything goes his way it&#8217;s almost maybe conceivable that Ali&#8217;s team is decent. But I think it&#8217;s pretty unlikely that all of these work out:
</p>
<ul><li>Kaep has a colossal year, justifying the 18th overall pick.</li>
  <li>Larry Fitzgerald is rejuvenated by Carson Palmer and returns to &#8216;07-&#8216;08 form.</li>
  <li>Arian Foster gets hurt, clearing the way for a monster season from Ben Tate.</li>
</ul><p>I think this is going to be a rough season for Ali. Also, pick a new team name bro.</p>
<p class="score text-big">Draft Grade: D</p>

<h3 class="matchup-names">ZM</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Orange County Gunners</h6>
<p>
It&#8217;s not even worth writing up an auto-drafted roster. I don&#8217;t hate this lineup but contending for a championship with Ben Roethlisberger at the helm is nigh impossible in this league. And ZM: if I have to see &#8220;Orange County Gunners&#8221; on the scoreboard for another entire season there will be consequences.
