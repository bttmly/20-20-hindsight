<div class="perma-only"> 
<p>The injuries this week are pretty extensive. As usual, paraphrased from <a href="http://espn.go.com/fantasy/blog/_/name/bell_stephania/id/8494401">Stephania Bell</a>.</p><!-- more -->
<p>Just a week after suffering a concussion <strong>RG3</strong> is widely expected to play on Sunday. Letting a high-profile rising star play just a week out from a concussion would seem to run counter to everything the NFL has been trying to do to mitigate criticism over the concussion crisis, but who knows? Stephania Bell ranted about the Redskins handling of this situation on Friday&#8217;s <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=2942325">Fantasy Focus Football podcast</a> and on her blog, specifically how the concussion was labeled &#8220;mild&#8221; immediately. She claims the severity can&#8217;t be known until symptoms have cleared, which they <em>apparently</em> have.</p>
<p><strong>Alex Smith</strong> sprained the middle finger of his throwing hand at the end of last week&#8217;s game against Buffalo. He&#8217;s practiced fully all week, and Tim Hasselbeck has noted that the middle finger is not crucially important for a quarterback&#8217;s delivery, unlike the index and pinky. Sounds like this is something of a non-issue.</p>
<p>At this point we&#8217;re all aware <strong>Cedric Benson</strong> is on IR-DTR (designated to return). The Packers <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcnorth/post/_/id/47626/">have said</a> they&#8217;ll take a &#8220;hot hand&#8221; approach to the carry split between <strong>Alex Green</strong> and <strong>James Starks</strong>, with Green getting the first crack at it.</p>
<p><strong>AP</strong> suffered a mild ankle sprain last week in the same leg as his reconstructed knee. The worry here is the riskiness of having a weakened ankle supporting the knee; he&#8217;ll presumably be heavily braced and taped should he play. He&#8217;s listed as questionable right now but with his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine_(comics)#Powers_and_abilities">Wolvorine-like</a> healing abilities I&#8217;d assume he&#8217;ll take the field against the Redskins.</p>
<p>Indianapolis running back <strong>Donald Brown</strong> had a minor scope surgery this week on his knee and will sit for two weeks or more. Backup <strong>Vick Ballard</strong> will start for the Colts.</p>
<p>With Arizona running backs <strong>Beanie Wells</strong> and <strong>Ryan Williams</strong> both out for the season (actually Wells is on IR-DTR but you know what I mean) it&#8217;s time for <strong>LaRod Stephens-Howling</strong> and <strong>William Powell</strong> to step up. Powell is working back from a concussion and Stephens-Howling has a strained hip flexor&#8230; so who knows?</p>
<p><strong>Percy Harvin</strong> was a midweek addition to the injury report with a sore hamstring. Fellow Vikings receiver <strong>Jerome Simpson</strong> is still dealing with some kind of leg weakness/numbness due to a back issue. My guess - Harvin plays, Simpson sits.</p>
<p>Man there&#8217;s still a bunch more guys on this list. Just go read <a href="http://espn.go.com/fantasy/blog/_/name/bell_stephania/id/8494401">ESPN&#8217;s injury blog</a>. I have to get back to work (haha just kidding).</p>
