<p class="lede">A truly ignominious week for most of us. I finished the recap ASAP to put this in the rear view and move on.</p><!-- more -->
<p>Hopefully, in retrospect, this week will stand as our league&#8217;s low-water mark for the season. I mean&#8230; Fuck. Of our 14 teams, four failed to reach 60 points and 10 came short of 85. Beyond the miserable point totals, none of the matchups were particularly exciting either. The closest margin of victory was 13, and there were 56- and 75-point shellackings. Let&#8217;s go ahead and get this over with as quickly as possible.</p>

Justin</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Brees: Fantasy Jesus v. Deez Nutz Reign On Your Parade</h6>
<p>One of the cardinal rules of fantasy sports is <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;tab=ww&amp;authuser=0#authuser=0&amp;hl=en&amp;q=fantasy+football+always+start+your+studs&amp;safe=on"><em>"Always start your studs."</em></a> Yes, Justin should have played Cam Newton this week no matter what. If you&#8217;re benching your second round pick in Week 3 then he better be fucking hospitalized or incarcerated. Cam was neither hand he put up 33 to Eli&#8217;s 2. That said, this matchup was way, way out of reach anyway, but maybe the silver lining for Justin is that he learns a lesson here. Acutally, and incredibly, if Justin had started Cam over Eli, Denarius Moore over Robert Turbin (not really a stretch since Turbin absolutely shouldn&#8217;t be starting in any fantasy league) and the Bengals D/ST over the Niners (never, ever would have expected that) he would have been within 7 points of Zak. Anyway, when your QB puts up 2FP and you have two goose-eggs you&#8217;re probably screwed. The only positive was Eric Decker (19FP), who had his first big game of the season with eight catches for 133 yards and a touchdown.</p>
<p>Get this: Zak piled up 126 points <em>despite five starters posting six or fewer fantasy points!</em> Zak could have benched everybody but Brees and Graham and still won by double digits. This should go without saying but when Graham catches two touchdowns Zak&#8217;s going to be very, very tough to beat. Antonio Brown also pitched in with one of the best receiving performances of the season so far – 31FP on nine catches for 196 yards and two touchdowns, including this <a href="http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2013/09/amazingcatch.gif">bonkers grab</a>.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>Justin<span>(0-3)</span></span><span>51</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Zak<span>(2-1)</span></span><span>126</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup2" class="matchup-names">Hoop v. ZM</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">I&#8217;m Not a Star v. Skating on Thin Ice</h6>
<p>Hoop advances to 2-1 here largely thanks to Josh Gordon, who – just FYI – is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0V3M6yM3_w">good</a> at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6R_VKhnpNA">football</a>. Gordon racked up 146 yards and a score on 10 catches as third-string quarterback Brian Hoyer led the Browns to an upset over the Vikings. This was kind of hilarious, since after the Richardson trade last week it was clear the Browns&#8217; intent was to lose as many games as possible and likely target a quarterback at the top of next year&#8217;s draft. After their accidental win, Cleveland is pulling out all the stops to make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen again: they&#8217;ve put Gordon <a href="http://fansided.com/2013/09/24/detroit-lions-talked-josh-gordon-trade-cleveland-browns/">trade block</a>, and probably <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/browns/2013/09/23/coach-rob-chudzinski-undecided-on-starting-quarterback-cincinnati-bengals-week-4/2855783/">won&#8217;t start</a> Hoyer (punishment for winning). Only the Browns could fail when all they&#8217;re trying to do is lose. </p>
<p>Oops, I was supposed to be writing about this matchup. One interesting thing about Gordon potentially being traded is that since Nate Burleson&#8217;s ridiculous car crash last night (we&#8217;ll dive into this more later), the Lions have apparently expressed interest in the Cleveland speedster. That would be interesting since Hoop happens to have Stafford as well. Just food for thought. Speaking of Stafford, he&#8217;s been pretty solid through three games; he&#8217;s seventh at the position with six touchdowns and 1020 yards(!!!) already, along with three turnovers. Nobody else really stood out, but AP chipped in 13 and three different guys posted nine. Good enough when you&#8217;re facing ZM.</p>
<p>Not starting Joique Bell when it&#8217;s clear Reggie Bush isn&#8217;t going to play is&#8230; bad. ZM&#8217;s team overall though doesn&#8217;t really look like an 0-3 squad. Given the roster setup this year, getting a stud running back in the first and following that up with two very good receivers looks like a strong play. As I&#8217;ve mentioned before though, QB is the glaring weakness here. And getting a combined -4FP from your kicker and defense is pretty rough too.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>ZM<span>(0-3)</span></span><span>73</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Hoop<span>(2-1)</span></span><span>99</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup3" class="matchup-names">Nick v. Ali</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Steamin&#8217; Jimmy Beamen v. BARTENDER! New Team Please</h6>
<p>I was certainly lucky to get out of this with a win. My big mistake happened Thursday night when I tried to avoid playing a defense against the Eagles, which, until further notice, is not a thing. The Chiefs D/ST amassed 30 FP on five takeaways and a touchdown against the Eagles in that game. I did have three guys starting in that game, and while LeSean McCoy (21FP) continued his monster start to the season, Alex Smith (13FP) was unimpressive and Dwayne Bowe posted a nice fat donut. I felt like <a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/75316e9f43aade4b68c42dad23fa46cf/tumblr_mrsoapHwIX1sp7ha5o1_400.gif">this</a> on Sunday so I barely watched any football, and when I woke up expected to be down substantially to Ali.</p>
<p>But no – I was leading comfortably! After putting up a big 120 in Week 1, Ali has scored just 100 in the last two weeks <em>combined</em>. This is largely due to a miserable two game stretch for his top five draft picks. Those picks were C.J. Spiller, Colin Kaepernick, Larry Fitzgerald, Darren Sproles, and Tony Gonzalez. Over the past two weeks those five guys have <em>totaled</em> just 37 points. Or 3.7 points per guy per game. That is&#8230; not good. He needs, bare minimum, three of these guys to start performing to their draft position in order to turn this season around. Until that happens, Ali will keep putting up embarassing point totals.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>Ali<span>(1-2)</span></span><span>49</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Nick<span>(3-0)</span></span><span>71</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup4" class="matchup-names">Jenny v. Phil</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Niner Faithful v. Shawp City Cake Beaters</h6>
<p>The last two weeks have looked remarkably simlar for Jenny: lean on Peyton and the Seahawks defense, and hope everyone else pitches in enough to secure a win. So far, so good. Peyton (29FP) and the Denver offense carpet-bombed the Raiders for 27 points in the first half before easing up. The Seahawks defense likewise was rolling for the first half of their tilt with Jacksonville before allowing 17 points over the final two quarters. Elsewhere things weren&#8217;t so great, with A.J. Green managing just 10, and her only viable running back, Rashard Mendenhall, grinding out a measley three fantasy points.</p>
<p>Phil left an awful lot of points on the bench here. If &#8220;always start your studs&#8221; is rule #1 in fantasy football, rule #2 should be something along the lines of &#8220;always start decent players against terrible teams&#8221;. Jacksonville is a terrible team, and the Russel Wilson–Sidney Rice duo sitting on Phil&#8217;s bench netted a combined 46FP. After two subpar weeks from Wilson and two studly weeks from Rivers, Phil switched them up at the wrong time and got burned. Of his six position players only Fred Jackson (10FP) managed double digits while none of the rest even reached five. This matchup would have been a lot uglier had the Bears D/ST not kicked in 29FP behind five takeaways and two defensive touchdowns. Look, the biggest factor in defensive scoring is luck. The trajectory of a tipped ball, or the bounce a fumble takes, can make all the difference. That said, when these opportunities present themselves, nobody is better at taking advantage than the Bears. Maybe it&#8217;s because they got to practice on their <em>nine</em> defensive touchdowns last season. Whatever the reason, you can clearly see the Chicago defense shift into scoring mode every time they come up with the ball, and it&#8217;s really fucking cool.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>Phil<span>(0-3)</span></span><span>74</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Jenny<span>(3-0)</span></span><span>92</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup5" class="matchup-names">Paul v. Brian</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">Only Winners Get Wings v. Hurry Up With My Damn Croissants</h6>
<p>Before we get into the matchup recap, I need to go over something that happened on the free agent wire this morning. Sorry Paul. Anyway, since I guess his life is horrible, Paul was up at 5:25AM, presumably to go to work. He wanted to fiddle with his roster a bit, and, inexplicably, dropped Le&#8217;Veon Bell for Nate Burleson. Now, keep in mind that news started to come out last night that <a href="https://twitter.com/JayGlazer/statuses/382347352171769856">Bell was expected debut Week 4</a>. At this point Paul&#8217;s maneuver was dropping a #1 running back for a (distant) #2 receiver – already pretty bad. It got much worse minutes later when news of a <a href="https://twitter.com/davebirkett/status/382489845584506880">car crash</a> involving Nate Burleson began to circulate on Twitter. Of course the first thing you jump to with a very late night single-car accident is drunk driving. Not in this case! Burleson lost control of his car as he was trying to <a href="http://deadspin.com/nate-burleson-crashes-suv-and-breaks-arm-trying-to-resc-1377427836" class="all-caps">save a pizza</a> from sliding off his front seat. Blissfully unaware of the car accident, Paul goes off to work whistling. Three hours later, having forgotten to make any adds last night, I fire up my computer to make some moves and discover Le&#8217;Veon Bell, presumptive starting running back for the Pittsburgh Steelers, sitting there in the free agent pool.</p>
<figure><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/e420cfc78c5f55551f55fe7079ba6834/tumblr_mk15fg5fcs1qg39ewo1_500.gif"/><figcaption class="text-big text-center">How I felt when I picked up Le&#8217;Veon Bell.</figcaption></figure><p>As I mentioned in the draft report card, I think Romo will wind up as the steal of this draft. He put up his best outing of the season so far with three touchdowns, 210 yards, and no turnovers in the Cowboys&#8217; 31-7 romp over the Rams. Megatron pitched in 17 and the Saints &#8220;No Really, The Saints&#8221; D/ST had 15. The New Orleans defense is one of the more interesting stories through three weeks; after a historically bad 2012 season and few major improvements, they&#8217;ve been above average so far this year. Like most people this week, he had a bunch of people in the low or middle single-digits, including disappointing outings by Andre Johnson and Jason Witten. While he was able to secure a win and get off the schneid, the flub with Le&#8217;Veon bell detailed above and the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9708576/jermichael-finley-green-bay-packers-concussion">gnarly concussion</a> suffered by Jermichael Finley leave Paul&#8217;s team in a tough spot going forward.</p>
<p>Marshawn Lynch has 40 points this season; 10 combined against the Panthers and Jags, 30 against the Niners. Let that sink in for a sec. Anyway, this was a tough week for Brian, with bad-not-horrible performances from a bunch of his key guys. The aforementioned Lynch managed just 69 yards on his 17 carries (4.1 YPC) against the Jags, the same team that was gashed by Darren McFadden last week for 129 yards on 19 carries (6.8 YPC). RG3 had by far his worst game of the season, with 10FP behind two turnovers and zero scores. Matt Forte&#8217;s strong start is the only thing to get excited about here. Through three games he&#8217;s the fifth highest scoring running back, having notched 363 scrimmage yards and a pair of scores over the Bears&#8217; first three contests. For reference, he was the 14th RB off the board in our draft. From a talent standpoint I still think Brian&#8217;s team is above average, but RG3 has to turn things around ASAP for Brian to succeed. If he can&#8217;t do it Week 4 against Oakland it may be time to put him on the shelf for a bit, even after he comes back from the Week 5 bye.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>Brian<span>(1-2)</span></span><span>67</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Paul<span>(1-2)</span></span><span>80</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup6" class="matchup-names">Dave v. Pat</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">The Sultan of Squats v. HACKSAW! Ball So Hard University</h6>
<p>In the draft report cards I kept harping on the idea of drafting lottery tickets, which is exactly about finding guys like Jordan Cameron. Dave snagged three guys in particular that all offered lottery ticket upside: Cameron, DeAndre Hopkins, and Cordarelle Patterson. He&#8217;s already cut ties with Patterson, but Hopkins has worked out fine so far and could improve as the season goes on, and Cameron is a bona fide stud already. Through three games the guy already has 20 catches and four touchdowns, and he&#8217;s the second highest scoring tight end by a comfortable margin. Obviously he won&#8217;t be scoring on 20% of his catches all season long, but he looks very much like the real deal at this point. On the other hand, the Browns need to lose, and lose now dammit! As mentioned above they tried to start Tankapalooza &#8216;13 by dealing Richardson, and are doubling down now by taking offers for Josh Gordon. There&#8217;s no way they trade this guy, but I honestly woulnd&#8217;t be shocked if they shelved him with some kind of mysterious injury. I mean, the Cleveland offense has scored five touchdowns this year. Cameron has four.</p>
<p>Enough about the Great White Hope. While Dave&#8217;s Aaron Rodgers and Julio Jones didn&#8217;t come through huge this week, DeMarco Murray&#8217;s <a href="http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/09/22/demarco-murray-likes-playing-the-rams/">love affair with the Rams</a> propelled him to a 25FP outing, while Giovani Bernard (15FP) found the end zone and had a nice day running and receiving. It was more than enough to secure a resounding win over Pat.</p>
<p>As if to illustrate one of my other hobbyhorses from the report cards, going after defenses early is not smart. While other people were drafting useful starting position players in the seventh round, Pat grabbed the Texans D/ST. Other people that went after defenses early include Justin taking the 49ers defense in the fourth round, and Jenny taking the Seahawks in the sixth. While that has worked out for Jenny so far, the Texans and Niners D/ST units are currently 26th and 27th in fantasy scoring at the position respectively. Incidentally, <a href="http://static.someecards.com/someecards/usercards/80e7bc365b34d7ee65c24380543fb15349.png">I drafted</a> the Chiefs D/ST in the back half of the 13th round and they&#8217;re currently first in D/ST scoring (I was definitely targeting the KC defense, but certainly didn&#8217;t expect this kind of production and obviously don&#8217;t expect it to last).</p>
<p>Anyway, the bigger problem has clearly been Arian Foster (5FP) and his early-season struggles. He&#8217;s back at 17th among RBs, and the Texans look pretty listless so far on both sides of the ball. Matty Ice has been good-not-great, as has Frank Gore. The strength of this roster largely rests in the big play ability of Victor Cruz and Tavon Austin which puts Pat in a tough spot if his QB-RB scoring core doesn&#8217;t start producing.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>Pat<span>(1-2)</span></span><span>53</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Dave<span>(3-0)</span></span><span>109</span></span></p>
<h3 id="matchup7" class="matchup-names">Max v. AJ</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">The Super Snakes v. The Chesapeake Ripper</h6>
<p>Like many of us, AJ had five guys score five or fewer points. If you add in first rounder Ray Rice (out with injury), and fourth rounder Vernon Davis (ditto), he got a combined 17FP from his top six picks. That&#8217;s a game you just aren&#8217;t going to win. Vick struggled, with three giveaways against just a single touchdown, although he did pile up 99 rushing yards. On the bright side, Kenbrell Thompkins and Bilal Powell, both on the bench, showed signs of life with 16FP and 14FP respectively.</p>
<p>Max needs to move Cecil Shorts into his starting lineup. Hakeem Nicks, and the rest of the Giants offense is struggling badly. He should also try to find a passable tight end from somewhere, perhaps by offering up Nicks or Jennings – yes, there are teams who could use them. My original assessment of Max&#8217;s team wasn&#8217;t quite correct; he won&#8217;t really have to make any hard choices that he&#8217;ll end up regretting, at least not for a while. Until proven otherwise, Roddy White can&#8217;t be a starter. Likewise with Jennings and Nicks. So he&#8217;ll roll with Shorts, and if Brady puts up top-5 numbers from here on out he&#8217;ll end up in the playoffs.</p>
<p class="matchup-score"><span><span>AJ<span>(2-1)</span></span><span>59</span></span><span class="winner"><span>Max<span>(2-1)</span></span><span>84</span></span></p>
