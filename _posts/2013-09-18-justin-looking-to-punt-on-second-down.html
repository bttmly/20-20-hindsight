<p class="lede">Justin proposed an incredibly short-sighted trade today. Here&#8217;s why you should veto it.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Here&#8217;s the trade:</p>
<div class="inline-block-half">
  <ul><li><b>Zak gives up</b></li>
    <li>James Starks</li>
    <li>Knowshon Moreno</li>
    <li>Antonio Brown</li>
    <li>Golden Tate</li>
  </ul></div>
<div class="inline-block-half">
  <ul><li><b>Justin gives up</b></li>
    <li>Doug Martin</li>
    <li>Cam Newton</li>
    <li>Eric Decker</li>
    <li>Da&#8217;Rel Scott</li>
  </ul></div>
<p>I don&#8217;t even know where to start with this. Usually if there&#8217;s a lopsided trade we&#8217;d expect both parties know what they&#8217;re getting into, and so, fine go ahead. But this is so obscenely one-sided that you should really consider if you think it should go through.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s Only Been Two Weeks</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re only two weeks into the season. Justin drafted Doug Martin second overall, grabbed Cam at the end of the second and Decker at the beginning of the third. Yes, none of them have lived up to their draft position&#8230; <em>yet</em>. Sure, Decker has been overshadowed by Demaryius Thomas, Wes Welkler, and even Julius Thomas. But he <em>leads the team in <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/receiving/sort/receivingTargets">targets</a></em>. He&#8217;ll come around, and soon. How about Doug Martin? Yeah, he hasn&#8217;t been stellar but he&#8217;s still top-10 at his position! Finally, Cam Newton. Yep, his numbers don&#8217;t look good. Like, at all. But take another look at who he&#8217;s played. The Panthers hosted the fucking Seahawks in Week 1, and Cam still scored 14. Colin Kaepernick scored 1 against that same team a week ago. Then Carolina visited Buffalo, which has an up-and-coming and criminally underrated defense. Cam will not end the season as the 19th fantasy QB; I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s more likely that he ends up in the top five than outside the top 10. Oh, and Justin&#8217;s plan is to replace Cam with Eli. Yeah, Eli &#8220;7 Picks in Two Weeks&#8221; Manning. Let&#8217;s see what Justin is going to get in return for his three best players.</p>
<h3>Trash for Treasure</h3>
<p>Yep, Knowshon Moreno has been the best of Denver&#8217;s RBs in fantasy. But it&#8217;s been two fucking weeks. First, I&#8217;d be shocked if this state of affairs continued. Second, Denver has the messiest backfield-by-comittee in the league, so the upside on Moreno is nearly non-existent. Take away his fluky two touchdown outing last week and we&#8217;re not even having this conversation. Also, despite the point disparity, so far Moreno only has two more carries than Montee Ball. Let&#8217;s see who&#8217;s behind door number two&#8230; Mr. James Starks! Yes, concussions are funky and can linger. But Lacy&#8217;s prognosis is apparently <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/sports/index.ssf/2013/09/fantasy_football_injury_update_1.html">pretty good</a> already and the widespread belief is that Starks will start Week 3, then Lacy will be back <a href="http://www.thefinsiders.com/blog/2013/fantasy-mid-week-report-2">after the Packers&#8217; Week 4 bye</a>. It&#8217;s entirely possible that Lacy is out longer. But, he could also start <a href="http://lombardiave.com/2013/09/18/green-bay-packers-injury-update-eddie-lacy-play-sunday/">this week</a>. Let&#8217;s also keep in mind two things: the Redskins defense Starks ran roughshod over last week is <em>incredibly</em> bad; and the only reason he got 20 carries was because the game was a rout five minutes into the second quarter. Like Moreno, Starks likely had his best outing of the season last week. Also in this trade are Golden Tate and Antonio Brown, who were Zak&#8217;s fifth- and eighth-round picks respectively. In Brown&#8217;s case, basically we&#8217;re talking about trading a fifth rounder who has underperformed for Decker, a third rounder who has underperformed. Ridiculous, right? As for Tate, who gives a shit, he&#8217;s a non-factor.</p>
<p>If you want to keep a semblance of competitive balance, <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/pendingtrades?leagueId=584667">review the trade</a> and veto it.</p>
