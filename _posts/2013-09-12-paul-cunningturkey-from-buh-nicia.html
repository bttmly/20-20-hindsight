<p class="lede">Dave stirs the pot with a little trash talk directed at his Week 2 opponent, Paul. I think he may be biting off more than he can chew.</p>

<p>The shit-talking in this league exists on a level matching the humor in <a href="http://20-20hindsight.tumblr.com/2013/09/12/2013-week-1-matchup-recaps.html%22%22">Nick’s Week 1 Matchup Recap</a>… which is to say, it is nonexistent.</p>

<p>That having been said, the best I can muster this week is to parody Paul’s<br/>
ridiculous last name replacing “ham” with the craven “turkey”. While his<br/>
team looks incredible his team-name is looking ironic. I hope to leave you<br/>
wingless you cellar dwelling ostrich*.</p>

<p><em>* I used ‘ostrich’ because they cannot fly and I assume Paul’s team name infers that winners get wings in order to fly. I highly doubt that Paul’s desire for wings is a purely ornamental endeavor.</em></p>
