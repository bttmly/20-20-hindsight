<p class="lede">Thoughts on five mediocre drafts.</p>

<p>Anybody else have opinions on the draft? Check out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AoRKjyVVVYxJdEJCUzg4WksxV1JRZU9VeGhUaUVDVFE&amp;usp=sharing">draft spreadsheet</a> and let it rip. Without further ado, let&#8217;s take a look at the so-so teams coming out of the draft.</p>

It&#8217;s a little harder to write objectively about the draft after a week of regular season action is in the books, and especially for Pat&#8217;s team. At the time of the draft Arian Foster appeared to be a somewhat risky pick, but with him starting tonight&#8217;s tilt against the Chargers those questions have largely evaporated. Matt Ryan at 23rd overall was just about right. Pat followed that up with Frank Gore, who was one of just two backs selected in the third round. That&#8217;s a tough spot to find a solid back but I can&#8217;t really argue the pick. Pat grabbed receivers Victor Cruz, Steve Smith, and Tavon Austin with his next three picks. I think this was a solid way to flesh out a roster with two backs and a strong quarterback already in place. But the mid- to late-round picks are important too and I didn&#8217;t like Pat&#8217;s picks on the back end, starting with the Houston D/ST in the seventh. He followed that up with Antonio Gates which was a nice upside selection. His next five picks were Jonathan Dwyer, Quinton Patton, Jonathan Franklin, Andy Dalton, and Pierre Thomas. Yikes. He did get Young GZ in the last round, but the lack of serviceable backups will really cause headaches when his starters can&#8217;t go.

This might be an overreaction but I&#8217;m much lower on this team now than I was a week ago. MJD was impotent against the Chiefs, and he&#8217;ll be facing a loaded box more often than not given that defenses worried one bit about Blaine Gabbert&#8217;s arm. David Wilson&#8230; ouch. Remember how he spent half of last season in the dog house after fumbling in the opener? Yeah well he fumbled twice in this season&#8217;s first game. The Giants are probably on the line with Michael Turner and Willis McGahee at this very moment. Aside from Vincent Jackson, who had 154 yards receiving in week 1 but failed the find the end zone, Phil has some major question marks at receiver. On the other hand, Fred Jackson and Andre Roberts got more run than expected and Jared Cook was an absolute monster. As usual though it&#8217;s hard to overstate the importance of the quarterback. Russel Wilson and the entire Seahawks offense looked listless for the better part of three quarters and were generally out-muscled a surprisingly stout Panthers defense. While Seattle somehow pulled out a win, it looked nothing like the offense that put up 58-0, 50-17, and 42-13 shellackings in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Seattle_Seahawks_season#Week_14:_vs._Arizona_Cardinals">consecutive weeks</a> last season. This is all to say that while I have no idea what to think of Phil&#8217;s team, I do think the process behind his draft was pretty solid. Obviously he could have waited much longer on a defense, and drafting a backup QB in the 14th has essentially zero value, but I really don&#8217;t see any big mistakes. Also, love the team name.

<h3 class="matchup-names">Hooper</h3>
<h6 class="matchup-teams">I&#8217;m Not A Star</h6>
<p>
I have some mixed feelings about this squad. Obviously AP at third overall is a steal, and with Brandon Marshall in the next round Hoop has a consistent scoring core to build around. After that I have a hard time finding a guy who can put up numbers consistently. Matt Stafford is always a threat, and he&#8217;ll be a steal in the third round if he bounces back to 2011 form, but he&#8217;s never been the most consistent quarterback. His next five picks all have similar consistency problems. I know the boom-or-bust agony of Torrey Smith first hand, Danny Amendola is a walking soft tissue injury, Ryan Mathews has early onset osteoporosis, Shane Vereen&#8217;s role on the Pats is unclear, and Josh Gordon is a deep threat playing with a quarterback who can&#8217;t throw deep. None of these guys lack talent but Hoop might have chronic heart palpitations by the end of this season. I liked Hoop&#8217;s late round guys, and despite Josh Freeman&#8217;s first game I still think he&#8217;s in for a big year (once Pro Bowl guard Carl Nicks gets back from his staph infection). Likewise Zach Sudfeld didn&#8217;t live up to the preseason hype in his first appearance but could still prove valuable. Clearly his biggest late-round gem was Julius Thomas who was more involved in the Denver offense than most expected. I liked the pick at the time and the concept of going with two upside tight ends on good offenses late in the draft is a strong move. I also thought grabbing the underrated Browns D/ST late was a nice pick. Hoop could easily lead the league in most games over 120 points <em>and</em> most games under 70 but I just don&#8217;t think that path leads to the playoffs. But in any given game the upside of this team will make Hoop&#8217;s opponent just as anxious as he&#8217;ll be.

Don&#8217;t drink and draft. Or maybe just stick with beer until the draft is over. That&#8217;s my suggestion. Not that I&#8217;m unhappy with my draft, but I definitely flubbed some picks. I got a lot of the guys I was targeting before the draft, including LeSean McCoy, Dwayne Bowe, Gronk, and Jordy Nelson, and I don&#8217;t feel like I reached on any of them. One pick I&#8217;m not that happy with is Andrew Luck in the third; I panicked and followed the rush on quarterbacks. Snaggin the Law Firm in the seventh wasn&#8217;t great either — his role will almost certinly decrease as the season progresses — but there wasn&#8217;t much else available at that position. I&#8217;m happy with Bryce Brown as a late handcuff with upside but my 10th, 11th, and 12th rounders were basically wasted; Greg Little and Kenny Stills aren&#8217;t even on my roster one week into the season. I was also targeting the Chiefs D/ST, but despite shutting out the Jags offense on Sunday we won&#8217;t know how good they really are until they get into their upcoming three-game stretch against the NFC East. I was so agitated by the end of the draft that I folded up shop early and autodrafted my kicker, blowing my chance to snag Legatron. I&#8217;d love it if someone else wants to provide an objective review of my draft.

I think Dave&#8217;s season will ultiamtely come down to how much work his running backs get. Right now it looks like Ahmad Bradshaw will get the bulk of the carries in Indy, but his balky feet are worrisome. Likewise, it appears that the Saints plan to ratchet up Mark Ingram&#8217;s workload, even though Ingram has been less than stellar over the past two years. Finally, rookie Giovani Bernard looked sensational on Hard Knocks and could be an X-factor for the Bengals this year. Bernard did get some goal line work in the preseason, but he&#8217;ll be competing with BenJarvus Green-Ellis for short-yardage carries and the Law Firm has performed well in that role in the past. Electing to go with Aaron Rodgers over any of the elite backs with the first overall pick was an interesting choice, and with 16 running backs coming off the board before Dave&#8217;s next pick he was stuck with DeMarco Murray, who is, let&#8217;s say, less than ideal as an RB1. Dave snagged a couple of interesting rookie lottery tickets later in the draft with DeAndre Hopkins and Cordarelle Patterson. If things break right – Rodgers justifies the first overall pick, Julio Jones emerges as the Falcons&#8217; clear #1 receiver, and the backs get enough carries – this could be one of the better teams in the league. Given how much uncertainty there is with this roster I can&#8217;t say that it is right now though.
